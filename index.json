We propose a “data-driven” coordination framework which manages to recover the same optimum as the equivalent centralized formulation while allowing coordinating agents to retain autonomy, privacy, and flexibility over their own objectives, constraints, and variables. This approach updates the coordinated, or shared, variables based on derivative-free optimization (DFO) using only coordinated variables to agent-level optimal subproblem evaluation “data.” We compare the performance of our framework using different DFO solvers (CUATRO, Py-BOBYQA, DIRECT-L, GPyOpt) against conventional distributed optimization (ADMM) on three case studies: collaborative learning, facility location, and multiobjective blending. We show that in low-dimensional and nonconvex subproblems, the exploration-exploitation trade-offs of DFO solvers can be leveraged to converge faster and to a better solution than in distributed optimization.","tags":["coordination","data-driven optimization","distributed optimization","expensive black-box"],"title":"Data-driven coordination of subproblems in enterprise-wide optimization under organizational considerations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Guoquan Wu","Miguel Ángel de Carvalho Servia","Max Mowbray"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1684322101,"objectID":"8eebe5f66f77c9d8da79a436ad4ec3ae","permalink":"https://optimalpse.github.io/publication/wu-2023100073/","publishdate":"2023-05-17T11:36:43.863247Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wu-2023100073/","section":"publication","summary":"Reinforcement Learning (RL) is an effective method to solve stochastic sequential decision-making problems. This is a problem description common to supply chain operations, however, most RL algorithms are tailored for game-based benchmarks. Here, we propose a deep RL method tailored for supply chain problems. The proposed algorithm deploys a derivative free approach to balance exploration and exploitation of the neural policy’s parameter space, providing means to avoid low quality local optima. Furthermore, the method allows consideration of risk-sensitive formulations to learn a policy that optimizes, for example, the conditional value-at-risk. The capabilities of our algorithm are tested on a multi-echelon supply chain problem, and several combinatorial optimization problems. The results empirically demonstrate the method’s improved sample efficiency compared to the benchmark algorithm proximal policy optimization, and superior performance to shrinking horizon mixed integer formulations. Additionally, its risk-sensitive policy can offer protection from low probability, high severity scenarios. Finally, we provide a sensitivity analysis for technical intuition.","tags":["Distributional reinforcement learning","Optimal control","Inventory management","Multi-echelon supply chains","Machine learning"],"title":"Distributional reinforcement learning for inventory management in multi-echelon supply chains","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Miguel Ángel de Carvalho Servia","Ilya Orson Sandoval","Klaus Hellgardt","King Kuok"," Hii","Dongda Zhang","Ehecatl Antonio del Rio Chanona"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1684321132,"objectID":"fb1864dd16a6175794ddcfc6874cde41","permalink":"https://optimalpse.github.io/publication/servia-automated-2023/","publishdate":"2023-05-17T11:36:45.207725Z","relpermalink":"/publication/servia-automated-2023/","section":"publication","summary":"The industrialization of catalytic processes is of far more importance today than it has ever been before and kinetic models are essential tools for their industrialization. Kinetic models affect the design, the optimization and the control of catalytic processes, but they are not easy to obtain. Classical paradigms, such as mechanistic modeling require substantial domain knowledge, while data-driven and hybrid modeling lack interpretability. Consequently, a different approach called automated knowledge discovery has recently gained popularity. Many methods under this paradigm have been developed, where ALAMO, SINDy and genetic programming are notable examples. However, these methods suffer from important drawbacks: they require assumptions about model structures, scale poorly, lack robust and well-founded model selection routines, and they are sensitive to noise. To overcome these challenges, the present work constructs two methodological frameworks, Automated Discovery of Kinetics using a Strong/Weak formulation of symbolic regression, ADoK-S and ADoK-W, for the automated generation of catalytic kinetic models. We leverage genetic programming for model generation, a sequential optimization routine for model refinement, and a robust criterion for model selection. Both frameworks are tested against three computational case studies of increasing complexity. We showcase their ability to retrieve the underlying kinetic rate model with a limited amount of noisy data from the catalytic system, indicating a strong potential for chemical reaction engineering applications.","tags":["Computer Science - Computational Engineering","Finance","and Science","Computer Science - Symbolic Computation","Quantitative Biology - Quantitative Methods"],"title":"The Automated Discovery of Kinetic Rate Models -- Methodological Frameworks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhengang Zhong","Ehecatl Antonio del Rio-Chanona","Panagiotis Petsagkourakis"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1684321872,"objectID":"65dba89c1b33167c9278df77737aec76","permalink":"https://optimalpse.github.io/publication/zhong-2023108112/","publishdate":"2023-05-17T11:36:44.599845Z","relpermalink":"/publication/zhong-2023108112/","section":"publication","summary":"Model predictive control (MPC) is an effective approach to control multivariable dynamic systems with constraints. Most real dynamic models are however affected by plant-model mismatch and process uncertainties, which can lead to closed-loop performance deterioration and constraint violations. Methods such as stochastic MPC (SMPC) have been proposed to alleviate these problems; however, the resulting closed-loop state trajectory might still significantly violate the prescribed constraints if the real system deviates from the assumed disturbance distributions made during the controller design. In this work we propose a novel data-driven distributionally robust MPC scheme for nonlinear systems. Unlike SMPC, which requires the exact knowledge of the disturbance distribution, our scheme decides the control action with respect to the worst distribution from a distribution ambiguity set. This ambiguity set is defined as a Wasserstein ball centered at the empirical distribution. Due to the potential model errors that cause off-sets, the scheme is also extended by leveraging an offset-free method. The favorable results of this control scheme are demonstrated and empirically verified with a nonlinear mass spring system and a nonlinear CSTR case study.","tags":["Model predictive control","Stochastic optimal control","Uncertain dynamic systems","Distributionally robust optimization","Wasserstein ambiguity set"],"title":"Tube-based distributionally robust model predictive control for nonlinear process systems via linearization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ilya Orson Sandoval","Panagiotis Petsagkourakis","Ehecatl Antonio del Rio-Chanona"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1667260800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1684321132,"objectID":"3714898b5ad3f9db5a1280364eade5f1","permalink":"https://optimalpse.github.io/publication/sandoval-neural-2022/","publishdate":"2023-05-17T11:36:44.964168Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sandoval-neural-2022/","section":"publication","summary":"Neural ordinary differential equations (Neural ODEs) define continuous time dynamical systems with neural networks.

Reinforcement learning by policy optimization would be a natural way to solve this due to its ability to address stochasticity, plant-model mismatch, and directly account for the effect of future uncertainty and its feedback in a proper closed-loop manner; all without the need of an inner optimization loop. One of the main reasons why reinforcement learning has not been considered for industrial processes (or almost any engineering application) is that it lacks a framework to deal with safety critical constraints. Present algorithms for policy optimization use difficult-to-tune penalty parameters, fail to reliably satisfy state constraints or present guarantees only in expectation. We propose a chance constrained policy optimization (CCPO) algorithm which guarantees the satisfaction of joint chance constraints with a high probability — which is crucial for safety critical tasks. This is achieved by the introduction of constraint tightening (backoffs), which are computed simultaneously with the feedback policy. Backoffs are adjusted with Bayesian optimization using the empirical cumulative distribution function of the probabilistic constraints, and are therefore self-tuned. This results in a general methodology that can be imbued into present policy optimization algorithms to enable them to satisfy joint chance constraints with high probability. We present case studies that analyse the performance of the proposed approach.","tags":["Policy search","Reinforcement Learning","Data-driven process control","Chance constraints","Bayesian Optimization"],"title":"Chance Constrained Policy Optimization for Process Control and Optimization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sophie Sitter","Damien van de Berg","Max Mowbray","Antonio del Rio Chanona","Panagiotis Petsagkourakis"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1684321131,"objectID":"df9284ef1d0fa5e9868786876c7b1932","permalink":"https://optimalpse.github.io/publication/sitter-convex-2022/","publishdate":"2023-05-17T11:36:44.354769Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sitter-convex-2022/","section":"publication","summary":"Over the last decade, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has received significant attention as it promises novel and efficient solutions to complex control problems.

One key to this challenge, is to model and optimise the light/dark cycles so that cells within the dark region can be frequently transferred to the light region for photosynthesis. Therefore, this study proposes the first mechanistic model to integrate the light/dark cycle effects into biomass growth kinetics. This model was initially constructed through theoretical derivation based on the intracellular reaction kinetics, and was subsequently modified by embedding a new parameter, effective light coefficient, to account for the effects of culture mixing. To generate in silico process data, a new multiscale reactive transport modelling strategy was developed to couple fluid dynamics with biomass growth kinetics and light transmission. By comparing against previous experimental and computational studies, the multiscale model shows to be of high accuracy. Based on its simulation result, an original correlation was proposed to link effective light coefficient with photobioreactor gas inflow rate; this has not been done before. The impact of this study is that by using the proposed mechanistic model and correlation, we can easily control and optimise photobioreactor gas inflow rates to alleviate light attenuation and maintain a high biomass growth rate.","tags":["biomass cultivation","culture mixing","light/dark cycle","multiscale kinetic modelling","photobioreactor design"],"title":"Synergising biomass growth kinetics and transport mechanisms to simulate light/dark cycle effects on photo-production systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Congratulations to Richard Hendricks for winning first place in the Wowchemy Prize.\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

Both mixed-integer programming and multiobjective optimization were formulated to effectively identify the best polymer candidates and their associated optimal synthesis route. Several commercial nitrogen-containing polymers including urea-formaldehyde and Nylon 1,6 were found to be promising candidates for future bioproduction. Moreover, the stability of current optimization results with respect to the availability of external nitrogen and hydrogen sources was also thoroughly analyzed. The results of this study can be used to guide the development of future renewable polymer production processes.

A novel CryoMan cascade liquefied natural gas (LNG) refrigeration cycle is selected as the case study which has been highlighted for potential use within industry. Given its high nonlinearity and dimensionality (31 input variables and 20 output variables with a number of physical constraints) and short time horizon for real-time decision-making, an time-efficient optimization scheme must be developed to maximize process performance. Therefore, various supervised and unsupervised learning techniques as well as surrogate model structures are explored in order to accurately capture the behaviour of this highly complex and interrelated process flowsheet. Optimal solutions identified by the surrogate models are validated against the rigorous process model. Following from the challenges encountered by artificial neural network based surrogate models, Gaussian processes were adopted and combined with partial least squares to simultaneously reduce dimensionality and capture the nonlinearity of the underlying chemical process. Through this innovative surrogate modelling strategy, overall time to optimize the LNG production process was reduced by orders of magnitude compared to the rigorous model based optimization methodology, hence significantly facilitating the industrial application of this new process.","tags":["chemical engineering","large scale optimization problem","efficient strategies for large scale complex systems","machine learning","model reduction"],"title":"Surrogate Modelling and Optimization for Complex Liquefied Natural Gas Refrigeration Cycles","type":"publication"},{"authors":["P.

However, bioprocesses are generally operated at unsteady-state conditions and are stochastic from a macro-scale perspective, making their optimisation a challenging task. Furthermore, as biological systems are highly complex, plant-model mismatch is usually present. To address the aforementioned challenges, in this work, we propose a reinforcement learning based online optimisation strategy. We first use reinforcement learning to learn an optimal policy given a preliminary process model. This means that we compute diverse trajectories and feed them into a recurrent neural network, resulting in a policy network which takes the states as input and gives the next optimal control action as output. Through this procedure, we are able to capture the previously believed behaviour of the biosystem. Subsequently, we adopted this network as an initial policy for the “real” system (the plant) and apply a batch-to-batch reinforcement learning strategy to update the network’s accuracy. This is computed by using a more complex process model (representing the real plant) embedded with adequate stochasticity to account for the perturbations in a real dynamic bioprocess. We demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed approach in a case study by computing the optimal policy in a realistic number of batch runs.","tags":["Reinforcement Learning","Batch Process","Recurrent Neural Networks","Bio-processes"],"title":"Reinforcement Learning for Batch-to-Batch Bioprocess Optimisation","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Bayesian optimisation has been successfully applied in a number of complex domains including engineering systems where derivatives are often not available, such as those that involve simulation or propriety software. By removing the human from decision-making processes in favour of maximising statistical quantities such as expected improvement, complex functions can be optimised in an efficient number of samples. However, these engineering systems are often engaged with by domain experts such as engineers or chemists, and as such the behaviour of the underlying function cannot be considered completely unknown a-priori. Therefore, there exists significant scope to take advantage of the benefits of Bayesian optimisation in optimising expensive derivative-free problems, whilst enabling domain experts to inform the decision-making process, putting the human back into the loop.\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02852\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"1c631e47d5b54409aee23fbc6f3f3510","permalink":"https://optimalpse.github.io/post/human-in-the-loop-bo/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/human-in-the-loop-bo/","section":"post","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Human-in-the-Loop Bayesian Optimization","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f1d044c0738ab9f19347f15c290a71a1","permalink":"https://optimalpse.github.io/research/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"My page","type":"landing"}]
