Kinetic models affect the design, the optimization and the control of catalytic processes, but they are not easy to obtain. Classical paradigms, such as mechanistic modeling require substantial domain knowledge, while data-driven and hybrid modeling lack interpretability. Consequently, a different approach called automated knowledge discovery has recently gained popularity. Many methods under this paradigm have been developed, where ALAMO, SINDy and genetic programming are notable examples. However, these methods suffer from important drawbacks: they require assumptions about model structures, scale poorly, lack robust and well-founded model selection routines, and they are sensitive to noise. To overcome these challenges, the present work constructs two methodological frameworks, Automated Discovery of Kinetics using a Strong/Weak formulation of symbolic regression, ADoK-S and ADoK-W, for the automated generation of catalytic kinetic models. We leverage genetic programming for model generation, a sequential optimization routine for model refinement, and a robust criterion for model selection. Both frameworks are tested against three computational case studies of increasing complexity. We showcase their ability to retrieve the underlying kinetic rate model with a limited amount of noisy data from the catalytic system, indicating a strong potential for chemical reaction engineering applications.","tags":["Computer Science - Computational Engineering","Finance","and Science","Computer Science - Symbolic Computation","Quantitative Biology - Quantitative Methods"],"title":"The Automated Discovery of Kinetic Rate Models -- Methodological Frameworks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhengang Zhong","Ehecatl Antonio del Rio-Chanona","Panagiotis Petsagkourakis"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1684321872,"objectID":"65dba89c1b33167c9278df77737aec76","permalink":"https://optimalpse.github.io/publication/zhong-2023108112/","publishdate":"2023-05-17T11:15:49.664805Z","relpermalink":"/publication/zhong-2023108112/","section":"publication","summary":"Model predictive control (MPC) is an effective approach to control multivariable dynamic systems with constraints. Most real dynamic models are however affected by plant-model mismatch and process uncertainties, which can lead to closed-loop performance deterioration and constraint violations. Methods such as stochastic MPC (SMPC) have been proposed to alleviate these problems; however, the resulting closed-loop state trajectory might still significantly violate the prescribed constraints if the real system deviates from the assumed disturbance distributions made during the controller design. In this work we propose a novel data-driven distributionally robust MPC scheme for nonlinear systems. Unlike SMPC, which requires the exact knowledge of the disturbance distribution, our scheme decides the control action with respect to the worst distribution from a distribution ambiguity set. This ambiguity set is defined as a Wasserstein ball centered at the empirical distribution. Due to the potential model errors that cause off-sets, the scheme is also extended by leveraging an offset-free method. The favorable results of this control scheme are demonstrated and empirically verified with a nonlinear mass spring system and a nonlinear CSTR case study.","tags":["Model predictive control","Stochastic optimal control","Uncertain dynamic systems","Distributionally robust optimization","Wasserstein ambiguity set"],"title":"Tube-based distributionally robust model predictive control for nonlinear process systems via linearization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ilya Orson Sandoval","Panagiotis Petsagkourakis","Ehecatl Antonio del Rio-Chanona"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1667260800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1684321132,"objectID":"3714898b5ad3f9db5a1280364eade5f1","permalink":"https://optimalpse.github.io/publication/sandoval-neural-2022/","publishdate":"2023-05-17T11:15:50.027726Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sandoval-neural-2022/","section":"publication","summary":"Neural ordinary differential equations (Neural ODEs) define continuous time dynamical systems with neural networks.

Reinforcement learning by policy optimization would be a natural way to solve this due to its ability to address stochasticity, plant-model mismatch, and directly account for the effect of future uncertainty and its feedback in a proper closed-loop manner; all without the need of an inner optimization loop. One of the main reasons why reinforcement learning has not been considered for industrial processes (or almost any engineering application) is that it lacks a framework to deal with safety critical constraints. Present algorithms for policy optimization use difficult-to-tune penalty parameters, fail to reliably satisfy state constraints or present guarantees only in expectation. We propose a chance constrained policy optimization (CCPO) algorithm which guarantees the satisfaction of joint chance constraints with a high probability — which is crucial for safety critical tasks. This is achieved by the introduction of constraint tightening (backoffs), which are computed simultaneously with the feedback policy. Backoffs are adjusted with Bayesian optimization using the empirical cumulative distribution function of the probabilistic constraints, and are therefore self-tuned. This results in a general methodology that can be imbued into present policy optimization algorithms to enable them to satisfy joint chance constraints with high probability. We present case studies that analyse the performance of the proposed approach.","tags":["Policy search","Reinforcement Learning","Data-driven process control","Chance constraints","Bayesian Optimization"],"title":"Chance Constrained Policy Optimization for Process Control and Optimization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sophie Sitter","Damien van de Berg","Max Mowbray","Antonio del Rio Chanona","Panagiotis Petsagkourakis"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1684321131,"objectID":"df9284ef1d0fa5e9868786876c7b1932","permalink":"https://optimalpse.github.io/publication/sitter-convex-2022/","publishdate":"2023-05-17T11:15:49.424006Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sitter-convex-2022/","section":"publication","summary":"Over the last decade, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has received significant attention as it promises novel and efficient solutions to complex control problems.

A convex Q-function surrogate is trained using semidefinite programming. The surrogate is then minimized to determine the optimal control action.

While ADMM seems to display faster initial convergence, explorative DFO optimization solvers seem promising in escaping local minimizers, especially in lower dimensions.","tags":["Derivative-free optimization","Expensive black-box","Surrogate optimization"],"title":"Data-driven coordination of expensive black-boxes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Damien van de Berg","Thomas Savage","Panagiotis Petsagkourakis","Dongda Zhang","Nilay Shah","Ehecatl Antonio del Rio-Chanona"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1684322101,"objectID":"099f49b89985e2abc5dde09253c689f3","permalink":"https://optimalpse.github.io/publication/vandeberg-2022117135/","publishdate":"2023-05-17T11:15:49.177524Z","relpermalink":"/publication/vandeberg-2022117135/","section":"publication","summary":"Most optimization problems in engineering can be formulated as ‘expensive’ black box problems whose solutions are limited by the number of function evaluations. Frequently, engineers develop accurate models of physical systems that are differentiable and/or cheap to evaluate. These models can be solved efficiently, and the solution transferred to the real system. In the absence of gradient information or cheap-to-evaluate models, one must resort to efficient optimization routines that rely only on function evaluations. Creating a model can itself be considered part of the expensive black box optimization process. In this work, we investigate how perceived state-of-the-art derivative-free optimization (DFO) algorithms address different instances of these problems in process engineering. On the algorithms side, we benchmark both model-based and direct-search DFO algorithms. On the problems side, the comparisons are made on one mathematical optimization problem and five chemical engineering applications: model-based design of experiments, flowsheet optimization, real-time optimization, self-optimizing reactions, and controller tuning. Various challenges are considered such as constraint satisfaction, uncertainty, problem dimension and evaluation cost. This work bridges the gap between the derivative-free optimization and process systems literature by providing insight into the efficiency of data-driven optimization algorithms in the process systems domain to advance the digitalization of the chemical and process industries.","tags":["Surrogate optimization","Black box optimization","Derivative free optimization","Process engineering","Machine learning","Digitalization"],"title":"Data-driven optimization for process systems engineering applications","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhengang Zhong","Ehecatl Antonio del Rio-Chanona","Panagiotis Petsagkourakis"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1684322101,"objectID":"ecd4b5acd45033dd11a42f1590c5a6a8","permalink":"https://optimalpse.github.io/publication/zhong-2022606/","publishdate":"2023-05-17T11:15:49.543829Z","relpermalink":"/publication/zhong-2022606/","section":"publication","summary":"Classical stochastic model predictive control (SMPC) methods assume that the true probability distribution of uncertainties in controlled systems is provided in advance. However, in real-world systems, only partial distribution information can be acquired for SMPC. The discrepancy between the true distribution and the distribution assumed can result in sub-optimality or even infeasibility of the system. To address this, we present a novel distributionally robust data-driven MPC scheme to control stochastic nonlinear systems. We use distributionally robust constraints to bound the violation of the expected state-constraints under process disturbance. Sequential linearization is performed at each sampling time to guarantee that the system's states comply with constraints with respect to the worst-case distribution within the Wasserstein ball centered at the discrete empirical probability distribution. Under this distributionally robust MPC scheme, control laws can be efficiently derived by solving a conic program. The competence of this scheme for disturbed nonlinear systems is demonstrated through two case studies.","tags":["Model predictive control"],"title":"Distributionally Robust MPC for Nonlinear Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ilya Stolyarov","Ilya Orson Sandoval","Panagiotis Petsagkourakis","Ehecatl Antonio del Rio-Chanona"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1684321132,"objectID":"c5717885037c83787a64b40dcf90abc2","permalink":"https://optimalpse.github.io/publication/stolyarov-piecewise-2022/","publishdate":"2023-05-17T11:15:49.907448Z","relpermalink":"/publication/stolyarov-piecewise-2022/","section":"publication","summary":"Complex systems which exhibit different dynamics based on their operating region pose challenges for data driven control because a single global model may not capture the varying dynamics of the system.

This article proposes a novel method of hybrid system identification through spectral clustering with a custom similarity function.

A key enabler of rapid response is having quality-oriented disease-agnostic manufacturing protocols ready ahead of outbreaks. We are the first to apply the Quality by Design (QbD) framework to enhance rapid-response RNA vaccine manufacturing against known and future viral pathogens. This QbD framework aims to support the development and consistent production of safe and efficacious RNA vaccines, integrating a novel qualitative methodology and a quantitative bioprocess model. The qualitative methodology identifies and assesses the direction, magnitude and shape of the impact of critical process parameters (CPPs) on critical quality attributes (CQAs). The mechanistic bioprocess model quantifies and maps the effect of four CPPs on the CQA of effective yield of RNA drug substance. Consequently, the first design space of an RNA vaccine synthesis bioreactor is obtained. The cost-yield optimization together with the probabilistic design space contribute towards automation of rapid-response, high-quality RNA vaccine production.","tags":["Drug development","RNA vaccines"],"title":"Quality by design modelling to support rapid RNA vaccine production against emerging infectious diseases","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bovinille Anye Cho","Miguel Ángel de Carvalho Servia","Ehecatl Antonio del Río Chanona","Robin Smith","Dongda Zhang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1684321132,"objectID":"5f67f1325cf62c630276e7e844367a2a","permalink":"https://optimalpse.github.io/publication/anye-cho-synergising-2021/","publishdate":"2023-05-17T11:15:50.150507Z","relpermalink":"/publication/anye-cho-synergising-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"Light attenuation is a primary challenge limiting the upscaling of photobioreactors for sustainable bio-production. One key to this challenge, is to model and optimise the light/dark cycles so that cells within the dark region can be frequently transferred to the light region for photosynthesis. Therefore, this study proposes the first mechanistic model to integrate the light/dark cycle effects into biomass growth kinetics. This model was initially constructed through theoretical derivation based on the intracellular reaction kinetics, and was subsequently modified by embedding a new parameter, effective light coefficient, to account for the effects of culture mixing. To generate in silico process data, a new multiscale reactive transport modelling strategy was developed to couple fluid dynamics with biomass growth kinetics and light transmission. By comparing against previous experimental and computational studies, the multiscale model shows to be of high accuracy. Based on its simulation result, an original correlation was proposed to link effective light coefficient with photobioreactor gas inflow rate; this has not been done before. The impact of this study is that by using the proposed mechanistic model and correlation, we can easily control and optimise photobioreactor gas inflow rates to alleviate light attenuation and maintain a high biomass growth rate.","tags":["biomass cultivation","culture mixing","light/dark cycle","multiscale kinetic modelling","photobioreactor design"],"title":"Synergising biomass growth kinetics and transport mechanisms to simulate light/dark cycle effects on photo-production systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Congratulations to Jian Yang and Monica Hall for winning the Best Paper Award at the 2020 Conference on Wowchemy for their paper “Learning Wowchemy”.\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
