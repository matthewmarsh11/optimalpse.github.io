Engineers often create precise models of physical systems that are either differentiable or inexpensive to evaluate. These models can be solved efficiently, and their solutions can be applied to the actual system. However, when gradient information or cost-effective models are not available, it becomes necessary to use efficient optimization methods that rely solely on function evaluations - \u0026#34;data\u0026#34;. These data-driven optimization algorithms are tailored to optimize functions without relying on explicit derivative information. The methods generally fall into two primary categories: model-based derivative-free methods, also referred to as surrogate-based optimization, and direct derivative-free methods. Model-based methods use information obtained through sampling the objective function to build, consult and update a model of the objective function during optimization. Direct methods navigate the optimization process based on sampled information only. Situated in-between these two categories are the finite-difference methods, which approximate derivatives using function evaluations.

Depending on the effort required to develop accurate models, it might be more efficient to jump the model-building step. Instead, we can use derivative-free optimization (DFO) - also known as black-box or \u0026#39;data-driven\u0026#39; optimization - for optimal controller tuning, reactor design, experiment design, or flowsheet design based purely on input-output evaluations. This would for example involve the use of Bayesian optimization or trust region methods to iteratively construct and optimize surrogates of the system\u0026#39;s input-output evaluations. Rather than use black-box optimization to optimize physical systems or simulations, we can solve complex coordination problems where the black-box evaluations involve optimization problems themselves. The holy grail of process systems operations would be to integrate all decision-making units that arise in the interaction between supply chain players and their hierarchical levels of decision-making. To this end, we can use DFO to determine the coordinating \u0026#39;complicating\u0026#39; variables in value chain and multi-level hierarchical planning-scheduling-control problems, otherwise determined by heuristics, decomposition techniques, or distributed optimization.

However, at the control layer, these set-points may be difficult to track due to challenges in implementation as a result of disturbances, measurement noise, and actuator performance limitations. To address this, we introduced the Adversarially Robust Real-Time Optimization and Control (ARRTOC) algorithm. ARRTOC addresses this issue by finding set-points which are both optimal and inherently robust to implementation errors at the control layers. ARRTOC draws inspiration from adversarial machine learning, offering a novel constrained Adversarially Robust Optimization solution applied to the RTO layer. By integrating controller design with RTO, ARRTOC enhances overall system performance and robustness by ensuring the chosen set-points are tailored to the underlying controller designs. This concept is best illustrated visually as per the attached figures, where the performance of a controller around two possible set-points is compared: the global optimum (scenario 1 in blue) and the adversarially robust optimum (scenario 2 in red). We observe that, paradoxically, operating at the adversarially robust optimum yields a 30% larger mean objective value compared to operating at the global optimum due to its inherent robustness.

Finding synthesis pathways from potential reactants towards the molecule or product of interest is challenging. Traditionally, expert chemists use their own intuition to find potential disconnection sites in the product molecule to arrive at one or more reactant intermediates. These intermediates are subject to further inspection to finally arrive at reactants (building blocks) that can be purchased off-shelf. The iterative process from the molecular product to building blocks is formally known as retrosynthesis. To aid scientists in this endeavor, researchers have proposed a variety of computational tools based on heuristics, reaction rules, or data-driven approaches. Within recent years, machine learning (ML) has received tremendous attention for retrosynthesis. While ML algorithms are seen to be successful at proposing viable synthesis routes towards simpler molecules, there are many remaining challenges until these techniques will have a significant impact on molecular synthesis and discovery.

Consequently, a different approach called automated knowledge discovery has recently gained popularity. Many methods under this paradigm have been developed, where ALAMO, SINDy and genetic programming are notable examples. However, these methods suffer from important drawbacks: they require assumptions about model structures, scale poorly, lack robust and well-founded model selection routines, and they are sensitive to noise. To overcome these challenges, the present work constructs two methodological frameworks, Automated Discovery of Kinetics using a Strong/Weak formulation of symbolic regression, ADoK-S and ADoK-W, for the automated generation of catalytic kinetic models. We leverage genetic programming for model generation, a sequential optimization routine for model refinement, and a robust criterion for model selection.

Reinforcement learning by policy optimization would be a natural way to solve this due to its ability to address stochasticity, plant-model mismatch, and directly account for the effect of future uncertainty and its feedback in a proper closed-loop manner; all without the need of an inner optimization loop. One of the main reasons why reinforcement learning has not been considered for industrial processes (or almost any engineering application) is that it lacks a framework to deal with safety critical constraints. Present algorithms for policy optimization use difficult-to-tune penalty parameters, fail to reliably satisfy state constraints or present guarantees only in expectation. We propose a chance constrained policy optimization (CCPO) algorithm which guarantees the satisfaction of joint chance constraints with a high probability — which is crucial for safety critical tasks. This is achieved by the introduction of constraint tightening (backoffs), which are computed simultaneously with the feedback policy. Backoffs are adjusted with Bayesian optimization using the empirical cumulative distribution function of the probabilistic constraints, and are therefore self-tuned. This results in a general methodology that can be imbued into present policy optimization algorithms to enable them to satisfy joint chance constraints with high probability.

Frequently, engineers develop accurate models of physical systems that are differentiable and/or cheap to evaluate. These models can be solved efficiently, and the solution transferred to the real system. In the absence of gradient information or cheap-to-evaluate models, one must resort to efficient optimization routines that rely only on function evaluations. Creating a model can itself be considered part of the expensive black box optimization process. In this work, we investigate how perceived state-of-the-art derivative-free optimization (DFO) algorithms address different instances of these problems in process engineering. On the algorithms side, we benchmark both model-based and direct-search DFO algorithms. On the problems side, the comparisons are made on one mathematical optimization problem and five chemical engineering applications: model-based design of experiments, flowsheet optimization, real-time optimization, self-optimizing reactions, and controller tuning. Various challenges are considered such as constraint satisfaction, uncertainty, problem dimension and evaluation cost. This work bridges the gap between the derivative-free optimization and process systems literature by providing insight into the efficiency of data-driven optimization algorithms in the process systems domain to advance the digitalization of the chemical and process industries.","tags":["Surrogate optimization","Black box optimization","Derivative free optimization","Process engineering","Machine learning","Digitalization"],"title":"Data-driven optimization for process systems engineering applications","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhengang Zhong","Ehecatl Antonio del Rio-Chanona","Panagiotis Petsagkourakis"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1684322101,"objectID":"ecd4b5acd45033dd11a42f1590c5a6a8","permalink":"https://optimalpse.github.io/publication/zhong-2022606/","publishdate":"2023-05-17T11:36:44.475287Z","relpermalink":"/publication/zhong-2022606/","section":"publication","summary":"Classical stochastic model predictive control (SMPC) methods assume that the true probability distribution of uncertainties in controlled systems is provided in advance. However, in real-world systems, only partial distribution information can be acquired for SMPC. The discrepancy between the true distribution and the distribution assumed can result in sub-optimality or even infeasibility of the system. To address this, we present a novel distributionally robust data-driven MPC scheme to control stochastic nonlinear systems. We use distributionally robust constraints to bound the violation of the expected state-constraints under process disturbance. Sequential linearization is performed at each sampling time to guarantee that the system's states comply with constraints with respect to the worst-case distribution within the Wasserstein ball centered at the discrete empirical probability distribution. Under this distributionally robust MPC scheme, control laws can be efficiently derived by solving a conic program.

Through the iterative creation of an approximate process model, control actions are able to be explored and optimal policies generated. Typically, this approximate process model has taken the form of a neural network that is continuously updated. However when small quantities of historical data are available, for example in novel processes, neural networks tend to over-fit to data providing poor performance. In this paper Gaussian processes are used as a method of function approximation to describe the action-value function of a non-isothermal semi-batch reactor. Through the use of analytical uncertainty obtained from Gaussian process predictions, trade off between exploration and exploitation is enabled, allowing for efficient generation of effective policies. Importantly Gaussian processes also enable probabilistic constraint violation to be modelled, ensuring safe constraint satisfaction throughout the learning procedure. On application to the in-silico case study, a safe, effective policy was generated utilising only 100 evaluations of process trajectory with no prior knowledge of the process dynamics.

One key to this challenge, is to model and optimise the light/dark cycles so that cells within the dark region can be frequently transferred to the light region for photosynthesis. Therefore, this study proposes the first mechanistic model to integrate the light/dark cycle effects into biomass growth kinetics. This model was initially constructed through theoretical derivation based on the intracellular reaction kinetics, and was subsequently modified by embedding a new parameter, effective light coefficient, to account for the effects of culture mixing. To generate in silico process data, a new multiscale reactive transport modelling strategy was developed to couple fluid dynamics with biomass growth kinetics and light transmission. By comparing against previous experimental and computational studies, the multiscale model shows to be of high accuracy. Based on its simulation result, an original correlation was proposed to link effective light coefficient with photobioreactor gas inflow rate; this has not been done before. The impact of this study is that by using the proposed mechanistic model and correlation, we can easily control and optimise photobioreactor gas inflow rates to alleviate light attenuation and maintain a high biomass growth rate.","tags":["biomass cultivation","culture mixing","light/dark cycle","multiscale kinetic modelling","photobioreactor design"],"title":"Synergising biomass growth kinetics and transport mechanisms to simulate light/dark cycle effects on photo-production systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Thomas Savage","Hector Fernando Almeida-Trasvina","Ehecatl Antonio del Río-Chanona","Robin Smith","Dongda Zhang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1684323406,"objectID":"5fb99e51fb2131ed1fb3542d2a849b51","permalink":"https://optimalpse.github.io/publication/savage-202073/","publishdate":"2023-05-17T11:36:46.430167Z","relpermalink":"/publication/savage-202073/","section":"publication","summary":"Current advances in computer-aided chemical process design and synthesis take advantage of surrogate modelling and superstructure optimization techniques.

The main bottleneck in the industrial application of DRTO is the presence of uncertainty. Many stochastic systems present the following obstacles: 1) plant-model mismatch, 2) process disturbances, 3) risks in violation of process constraints. To accommodate these difficulties, we present a constrained reinforcement learning (RL) based approach. RL naturally handles the process uncertainty by computing an optimal feedback policy. However, no state constraints can be introduced intuitively. To address this problem, we present a chance-constrained RL methodology. We use chance constraints to guarantee the probabilistic satisfaction of process constraints, which is accomplished by introducing backoffs, such that the optimal policy and backoffs are computed simultaneously. Backoffs are adjusted using the empirical cumulative distribution function to guarantee the satisfaction of a joint chance constraint. The advantage and performance of this strategy are illustrated through a stochastic dynamic bioprocess optimization problem, to produce sustainable high-value bioproducts.","tags":["Reinforcement learning","Uncertain dynamic systems","Stochastic control","Chemical process control","Adaptive control","Policy gradient"],"title":"Constrained Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Optimization under Uncertainty","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Thomas R.

To address the aforementioned challenges, in this work, we propose a reinforcement learning based online optimisation strategy. We first use reinforcement learning to learn an optimal policy given a preliminary process model. This means that we compute diverse trajectories and feed them into a recurrent neural network, resulting in a policy network which takes the states as input and gives the next optimal control action as output. Through this procedure, we are able to capture the previously believed behaviour of the biosystem. Subsequently, we adopted this network as an initial policy for the “real” system (the plant) and apply a batch-to-batch reinforcement learning strategy to update the network’s accuracy. This is computed by using a more complex process model (representing the real plant) embedded with adequate stochasticity to account for the perturbations in a real dynamic bioprocess.
