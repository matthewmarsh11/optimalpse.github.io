Real-Time Optimization (RTO) plays a crucial role in the process operation hierarchy by determining optimal set-points for the lower-level controllers. However, at the control layer, these set-points may be difficult to track due to challenges in implementation as a result of disturbances, measurement noise, and actuator performance limitations. To address this, we introduced the Adversarially Robust Real-Time Optimization and Control (ARRTOC) algorithm. ARRTOC addresses this issue by finding set-points which are both optimal and inherently robust to implementation errors at the control layers. ARRTOC draws inspiration from adversarial machine learning, offering a novel constrained Adversarially Robust Optimization solution applied to the RTO layer. By integrating controller design with RTO, ARRTOC enhances overall system performance and robustness by ensuring the chosen set-points are tailored to the underlying controller designs. This concept is best illustrated visually as per the attached figures, where the performance of a controller around two possible set-points is compared: the global optimum (scenario 1 in blue) and the adversarially robust optimum (scenario 2 in red). We observe that, paradoxically, operating at the adversarially robust optimum yields a 30% larger mean objective value compared to operating at the global optimum due to its inherent robustness.

Bayesian optimisation has been successfully applied in a number of complex domains including engineering systems where derivatives are often not available, such as those that involve simulation or propriety software. By removing the human from decision-making processes in favour of maximising statistical quantities such as expected improvement, complex functions can be optimised in an efficient number of samples. However, these engineering systems are often engaged with by domain experts such as engineers or chemists, and as such the behaviour of the underlying function cannot be considered completely unknown a-priori. Therefore, there exists significant scope to take advantage of the benefits of Bayesian optimisation in optimising expensive derivative-free problems, whilst enabling domain experts to inform the decision-making process, putting the human back into the loop.
