abstract = {Reinforcement Learning (RL) is an effective method to solve stochastic sequential decision-making problems. This is a problem description common to supply chain operations, however, most RL algorithms are tailored for game-based benchmarks. Here, we propose a deep RL method tailored for supply chain problems. The proposed algorithm deploys a derivative free approach to balance exploration and exploitation of the neural policy’s parameter space, providing means to avoid low quality local optima. Furthermore, the method allows consideration of risk-sensitive formulations to learn a policy that optimizes, for example, the conditional value-at-risk. The capabilities of our algorithm are tested on a multi-echelon supply chain problem, and several combinatorial optimization problems. The results empirically demonstrate the method’s improved sample efficiency compared to the benchmark algorithm proximal policy optimization, and superior performance to shrinking horizon mixed integer formulations. Additionally, its risk-sensitive policy can offer protection from low probability, high severity scenarios. Finally, we provide a sensitivity analysis for technical intuition.}

abstract = {Most optimization problems in engineering can be formulated as ‘expensive’ black box problems whose solutions are limited by the number of function evaluations. Frequently, engineers develop accurate models of physical systems that are differentiable and/or cheap to evaluate. These models can be solved efficiently, and the solution transferred to the real system. In the absence of gradient information or cheap-to-evaluate models, one must resort to efficient optimization routines that rely only on function evaluations. Creating a model can itself be considered part of the expensive black box optimization process. In this work, we investigate how perceived state-of-the-art derivative-free optimization (DFO) algorithms address different instances of these problems in process engineering. On the algorithms side, we benchmark both model-based and direct-search DFO algorithms. On the problems side, the comparisons are made on one mathematical optimization problem and five chemical engineering applications: model-based design of experiments, flowsheet optimization, real-time optimization, self-optimizing reactions, and controller tuning. Various challenges are considered such as constraint satisfaction, uncertainty, problem dimension and evaluation cost. This work bridges the gap between the derivative-free optimization and process systems literature by providing insight into the efficiency of data-driven optimization algorithms in the process systems domain to advance the digitalization of the chemical and process industries.}

However, in real-world systems, only partial distribution information can be acquired for SMPC. The discrepancy between the true distribution and the distribution assumed can result in sub-optimality or even infeasibility of the system. To address this, we present a novel distributionally robust data-driven MPC scheme to control stochastic nonlinear systems. We use distributionally robust constraints to bound the violation of the expected state-constraints under process disturbance. Sequential linearization is performed at each sampling time to guarantee that the system's states comply with constraints with respect to the worst-case distribution within the Wasserstein ball centered at the discrete empirical probability distribution. Under this distributionally robust MPC scheme, control laws can be efficiently derived by solving a conic program. The competence of this scheme for disturbed nonlinear systems is demonstrated through two case studies.}

abstract = {Integrating post-combustion carbon capture and storage (CCS) facilities into fossil fuel power plants is considered an important step for reaching global carbon emission reduction targets. When the number of gas analyzers in such CCS units is limited, variations in the load of the power plant pose a challenge to determine the gaseous CO2 concentration profile in the absorber. A dynamic hybrid model for estimating the carbon capture absorber’s gaseous CO2 concentration profile has been proposed in this study. The model is built using actual process data collected from a carbon capture pilot plant and it combines data-driven and reaction kinetic (mechanistic) modeling approaches to act as a soft sensor along the absorber column. A subset of the process data is used for training the data-driven models and for estimating the parameters of the mechanistic model respectively. Dimensionality reduction techniques are applied to the data-driven model to reduce the input size and hence the size of the dynamic model elements. The outputs of the two models are fused by comparing the computed covariance matrices. A particular challenge for this work is that the collected process data has missing spatial labels and temporal values for the CO2 concentration measurements. The presented models are obtained using an encoding and interpolation approach for the missing information. For comparison, an alternative approach based on semi-supervised learning has been implemented. The performance of the resulting soft sensors is verified by using process data from previously unseen operating conditions. The soft sensor based on the proposed hybrid model outperforms the soft sensor trained by semi-supervised autoencoder. Overall the results indicate that the proposed approach can estimate the CO2 concentration percentage with an average root mean squared error of 0.123.}

abstract = {Model predictive control (MPC) is an effective approach to control multivariable dynamic systems with constraints. Most real dynamic models are however affected by plant-model mismatch and process uncertainties, which can lead to closed-loop performance deterioration and constraint violations. Methods such as stochastic MPC (SMPC) have been proposed to alleviate these problems; however, the resulting closed-loop state trajectory might still significantly violate the prescribed constraints if the real system deviates from the assumed disturbance distributions made during the controller design. In this work we propose a novel data-driven distributionally robust MPC scheme for nonlinear systems. Unlike SMPC, which requires the exact knowledge of the disturbance distribution, our scheme decides the control action with respect to the worst distribution from a distribution ambiguity set. This ambiguity set is defined as a Wasserstein ball centered at the empirical distribution. Due to the potential model errors that cause off-sets, the scheme is also extended by leveraging an offset-free method. The favorable results of this control scheme are demonstrated and empirically verified with a nonlinear mass spring system and a nonlinear CSTR case study.}

Reinforcement learning by policy optimization would be a natural way to solve this due to its ability to address stochasticity, plant-model mismatch, and directly account for the effect of future uncertainty and its feedback in a proper closed-loop manner; all without the need of an inner optimization loop. One of the main reasons why reinforcement learning has not been considered for industrial processes (or almost any engineering application) is that it lacks a framework to deal with safety critical constraints. Present algorithms for policy optimization use difficult-to-tune penalty parameters, fail to reliably satisfy state constraints or present guarantees only in expectation. We propose a chance constrained policy optimization (CCPO) algorithm which guarantees the satisfaction of joint chance constraints with a high probability — which is crucial for safety critical tasks. This is achieved by the introduction of constraint tightening (backoffs), which are computed simultaneously with the feedback policy. Backoffs are adjusted with Bayesian optimization using the empirical cumulative distribution function of the probabilistic constraints, and are therefore self-tuned. This results in a general methodology that can be imbued into present policy optimization algorithms to enable them to satisfy joint chance constraints with high probability. We present case studies that analyse the performance of the proposed approach.}

Therefore, this study proposes the first mechanistic model to integrate the light/dark cycle effects into biomass growth kinetics. This model was initially constructed through theoretical derivation based on the intracellular reaction kinetics, and was subsequently modified by embedding a new parameter, effective light coefficient, to account for the effects of culture mixing. To generate in silico process data, a new multiscale reactive transport modelling strategy was developed to couple fluid dynamics with biomass growth kinetics and light transmission. By comparing against previous experimental and computational studies, the multiscale model shows to be of high accuracy. Based on its simulation result, an original correlation was proposed to link effective light coefficient with photobioreactor gas inflow rate; this has not been done before. The impact of this study is that by using the proposed mechanistic model and correlation, we can easily control and optimise photobioreactor gas inflow rates to alleviate light attenuation and maintain a high biomass growth rate.},

	abstract = {The industrialization of catalytic processes is of far more importance today than it has ever been before and kinetic models are essential tools for their industrialization. Kinetic models affect the design, the optimization and the control of catalytic processes, but they are not easy to obtain. Classical paradigms, such as mechanistic modeling require substantial domain knowledge, while data-driven and hybrid modeling lack interpretability. Consequently, a different approach called automated knowledge discovery has recently gained popularity. Many methods under this paradigm have been developed, where ALAMO, SINDy and genetic programming are notable examples. However, these methods suffer from important drawbacks: they require assumptions about model structures, scale poorly, lack robust and well-founded model selection routines, and they are sensitive to noise. To overcome these challenges, the present work constructs two methodological frameworks, Automated Discovery of Kinetics using a Strong/Weak formulation of symbolic regression, ADoK-S and ADoK-W, for the automated generation of catalytic kinetic models. We leverage genetic programming for model generation, a sequential optimization routine for model refinement, and a robust criterion for model selection. Both frameworks are tested against three computational case studies of increasing complexity. We showcase their ability to retrieve the underlying kinetic rate model with a limited amount of noisy data from the catalytic system, indicating a strong potential for chemical reaction engineering applications.},

A novel CryoMan cascade liquefied natural gas (LNG) refrigeration cycle is selected as the case study which has been highlighted for potential use within industry. Given its high nonlinearity and dimensionality (31 input variables and 20 output variables with a number of physical constraints) and short time horizon for real-time decision-making, an time-efficient optimization scheme must be developed to maximize process performance. Therefore, various supervised and unsupervised learning techniques as well as surrogate model structures are explored in order to accurately capture the behaviour of this highly complex and interrelated process flowsheet. Optimal solutions identified by the surrogate models are validated against the rigorous process model. Following from the challenges encountered by artificial neural network based surrogate models, Gaussian processes were adopted and combined with partial least squares to simultaneously reduce dimensionality and capture the nonlinearity of the underlying chemical process. Through this innovative surrogate modelling strategy, overall time to optimize the LNG production process was reduced by orders of magnitude compared to the rigorous model based optimization methodology, hence significantly facilitating the industrial application of this new process.}

abstract = {Abstract With liquefied natural gas becoming increasingly prevalent as a flexible source of energy, the design and optimization of industrial refrigeration cycles becomes even more important. In this article, we propose an integrated surrogate modeling and optimization framework to model and optimize the complex CryoMan Cascade refrigeration cycle. Dimensionality reduction techniques are used to reduce the large number of process decision variables which are subsequently supplied to an array of Gaussian processes, modeling both the process objective as well as feasibility constraints. Through iterative resampling of the rigorous model, this data-driven surrogate is continually refined and subsequently optimized. This approach was not only able to improve on the results of directly optimizing the process flow sheet but also located the set of optimal operating conditions in only 2 h as opposed to the original 3 weeks, facilitating its use in the operational optimization and enhanced process design of large-scale industrial chemical systems.},

abstract = {Model-free reinforcement learning has been recently investigated for use in chemical process control. Through the iterative creation of an approximate process model, control actions are able to be explored and optimal policies generated. Typically, this approximate process model has taken the form of a neural network that is continuously updated. However when small quantities of historical data are available, for example in novel processes, neural networks tend to over-fit to data providing poor performance. In this paper Gaussian processes are used as a method of function approximation to describe the action-value function of a non-isothermal semi-batch reactor. Through the use of analytical uncertainty obtained from Gaussian process predictions, trade off between exploration and exploitation is enabled, allowing for efficient generation of effective policies. Importantly Gaussian processes also enable probabilistic constraint violation to be modelled, ensuring safe constraint satisfaction throughout the learning procedure. On application to the in-silico case study, a safe, effective policy was generated utilising only 100 evaluations of process trajectory with no prior knowledge of the process dynamics. A result that would require significantly more trajectory evaluations when compared to a neural network based approach.}

abstract = {Dynamic real-time optimization (DRTO) is a challenging task due to the fact that optimal operating conditions must be computed in real time. The main bottleneck in the industrial application of DRTO is the presence of uncertainty. Many stochastic systems present the following obstacles: 1) plant-model mismatch, 2) process disturbances, 3) risks in violation of process constraints. To accommodate these difficulties, we present a constrained reinforcement learning (RL) based approach. RL naturally handles the process uncertainty by computing an optimal feedback policy. However, no state constraints can be introduced intuitively. To address this problem, we present a chance-constrained RL methodology. We use chance constraints to guarantee the probabilistic satisfaction of process constraints, which is accomplished by introducing backoffs, such that the optimal policy and backoffs are computed simultaneously. Backoffs are adjusted using the empirical cumulative distribution function to guarantee the satisfaction of a joint chance constraint. The advantage and performance of this strategy are illustrated through a stochastic dynamic bioprocess optimization problem, to produce sustainable high-value bioproducts.}

abstract = { Biomass-derived polymer production processes have been extensively studied to substitute petrochemical-based polymer synthesis routes. However, previous research predominantly focused on the synthesis of nitrogen-free polymers. Therefore, a novel superstructure reaction network was constructed in this study to convert different types of biomass waste into a range of commercial nitrogen-containing polymers. Trade-offs between process profit and greenness were analyzed to screen the large size of bioderived reaction pathways. Both mixed-integer programming and multiobjective optimization were formulated to effectively identify the best polymer candidates and their associated optimal synthesis route. Several commercial nitrogen-containing polymers including urea-formaldehyde and Nylon 1,6 were found to be promising candidates for future bioproduction. Moreover, the stability of current optimization results with respect to the availability of external nitrogen and hydrogen sources was also thoroughly analyzed. The results of this study can be used to guide the development of future renewable polymer production processes. }

abstract = {Current advances in computer-aided chemical process design and synthesis take advantage of surrogate modelling and superstructure optimization techniques. Conventionally, this is completed by using first-principle physical models or data-driven models to replace the original rigorous models for optimization and selection of a specific unit operation. Despite its achievements, this strategy is inefficient when dealing with complex process flowsheets such as utility and refrigeration systems where a large number of unit operations are heavily connected by recycling streams. To address this problem, an integrated data-driven modelling and optimization framework is proposed in this work. The framework first constructs a hybrid machine learning based surrogate model to automatically reduce the system dimensionality and capture the nonlinearity of the underlying chemical process. Then, an efficient optimization algorithm, in specific, evolutionary algorithm, is embedded to identify the optimal solution of this surrogate model. Quality and accuracy of the estimated optimal solution is finally validated against the rigorous process model. Through an iterative approach, optimal operating conditions for the entire process flowsheet are efficiently identified. Furthermore, the novel CryoMan Cascade cycle system for large scale liquefied natural gas manufacturing is used as the case study. This framework is demonstrated to be superior regarding time-efficiency, solution quality, and flexibility over the rigorous model based optimization approach.}

abstract = {Bioprocesses have received great attention from the scientific community as an alternative to fossil-based products by microorganisms-synthesised counterparts. However, bioprocesses are generally operated at unsteady-state conditions and are stochastic from a macro-scale perspective, making their optimisation a challenging task. Furthermore, as biological systems are highly complex, plant-model mismatch is usually present. To address the aforementioned challenges, in this work, we propose a reinforcement learning based online optimisation strategy. We first use reinforcement learning to learn an optimal policy given a preliminary process model. This means that we compute diverse trajectories and feed them into a recurrent neural network, resulting in a policy network which takes the states as input and gives the next optimal control action as output. Through this procedure, we are able to capture the previously believed behaviour of the biosystem. Subsequently, we adopted this network as an initial policy for the “real” system (the plant) and apply a batch-to-batch reinforcement learning strategy to update the network’s accuracy. This is computed by using a more complex process model (representing the real plant) embedded with adequate stochasticity to account for the perturbations in a real dynamic bioprocess. We demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed approach in a case study by computing the optimal policy in a realistic number of batch runs.}
