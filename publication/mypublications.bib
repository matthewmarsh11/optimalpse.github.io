	abstract = {Coordinating decision-making capacities using optimization is a key factor in the success of chemical companies. However, this coordination is often inhibited by expensive, legally-constrained, or proprietary subproblem models. We propose two variations on how model-based (surrogate) derivative-free optimization (DFO) methods can be used to coordinate subproblems with few connecting variables. When these surrogates are convex quadratic, they can be efficiently exploited using semidefinite programming techniques. We compare the performance of these two variations with a distributed optimization solver (ADMM), a model-based, and a direct DFO solver (Py-BOBYQA and DIRECTL). This comparison is done on four variations of an economic-environmental feedstock blending optimization case study. While ADMM seems to display faster initial convergence, explorative DFO optimization solvers seem promising in escaping local minimizers, especially in lower dimensions.},

This work builds on model-free RL, namely Q-learning, to determine optimal control policies for nonlinear, complex biochemical processes. We propose convex functions instead of deep neural networks as state-action value function approximators to reduce computational complexity. A convex Q-function surrogate is trained using semidefinite programming. The surrogate is then minimized to determine the optimal control action. This results in 75.3\% lower computational time compared with deep Q-networks.

The control policy optimization is posed as a Neural ODE problem to efficiently exploit the availability of a dynamical system model. We showcase the efficacy of this type of deterministic neural policies in two constrained systems: the controlled Van der Pol system and a bioreactor control problem.

	abstract = {Light attenuation is a primary challenge limiting the upscaling of photobioreactors for sustainable bio-production. One key to this challenge, is to model and optimise the light/dark cycles so that cells within the dark region can be frequently transferred to the light region for photosynthesis. Therefore, this study proposes the first mechanistic model to integrate the light/dark cycle effects into biomass growth kinetics. This model was initially constructed through theoretical derivation based on the intracellular reaction kinetics, and was subsequently modified by embedding a new parameter, effective light coefficient, to account for the effects of culture mixing. To generate in silico process data, a new multiscale reactive transport modelling strategy was developed to couple fluid dynamics with biomass growth kinetics and light transmission. By comparing against previous experimental and computational studies, the multiscale model shows to be of high accuracy. Based on its simulation result, an original correlation was proposed to link effective light coefficient with photobioreactor gas inflow rate; this has not been done before. The impact of this study is that by using the proposed mechanistic model and correlation, we can easily control and optimise photobioreactor gas inflow rates to alleviate light attenuation and maintain a high biomass growth rate.},

	abstract = {The industrialization of catalytic processes is of far more importance today than it has ever been before and kinetic models are essential tools for their industrialization. Kinetic models affect the design, the optimization and the control of catalytic processes, but they are not easy to obtain. Classical paradigms, such as mechanistic modeling require substantial domain knowledge, while data-driven and hybrid modeling lack interpretability. Consequently, a different approach called automated knowledge discovery has recently gained popularity. Many methods under this paradigm have been developed, where ALAMO, SINDy and genetic programming are notable examples. However, these methods suffer from important drawbacks: they require assumptions about model structures, scale poorly, lack robust and well-founded model selection routines, and they are sensitive to noise. To overcome these challenges, the present work constructs two methodological frameworks, Automated Discovery of Kinetics using a Strong/Weak formulation of symbolic regression, ADoK-S and ADoK-W, for the automated generation of catalytic kinetic models. We leverage genetic programming for model generation, a sequential optimization routine for model refinement, and a robust criterion for model selection. Both frameworks are tested against three computational case studies of increasing complexity. We showcase their ability to retrieve the underlying kinetic rate model with a limited amount of noisy data from the catalytic system, indicating a strong potential for chemical reaction engineering applications.},

A key enabler of rapid response is having quality-oriented disease-agnostic manufacturing protocols ready ahead of outbreaks. We are the first to apply the Quality by Design (QbD) framework to enhance rapid-response RNA vaccine manufacturing against known and future viral pathogens. This QbD framework aims to support the development and consistent production of safe and efficacious RNA vaccines, integrating a novel qualitative methodology and a quantitative bioprocess model. The qualitative methodology identifies and assesses the direction, magnitude and shape of the impact of critical process parameters (CPPs) on critical quality attributes (CQAs). The mechanistic bioprocess model quantifies and maps the effect of four CPPs on the CQA of effective yield of RNA drug substance. Consequently, the first design space of an RNA vaccine synthesis bioreactor is obtained. The cost-yield optimization together with the probabilistic design space contribute towards automation of rapid-response, high-quality RNA vaccine production.},

This approach updates the coordinated, or shared, variables based on derivative-free optimization (DFO) using only coordinated variables to agent-level optimal subproblem evaluation “data.” We compare the performance of our framework using different DFO solvers (CUATRO, Py-BOBYQA, DIRECT-L, GPyOpt) against conventional distributed optimization (ADMM) on three case studies: collaborative learning, facility location, and multiobjective blending. We show that in low-dimensional and nonconvex subproblems, the exploration-exploitation trade-offs of DFO solvers can be leveraged to converge faster and to a better solution than in distributed optimization.},
