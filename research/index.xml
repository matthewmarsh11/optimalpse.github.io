Bayesian optimisation has been successfully applied in a number of complex domains including engineering systems where derivatives are often not available, such as those that involve simulation or propriety software. By removing the human from decision-making processes in favour of maximising statistical quantities such as expected improvement, complex functions can be optimised in an efficient number of samples. However, these engineering systems are often engaged with by domain experts such as engineers or chemists, and as such the behaviour of the underlying function cannot be considered completely unknown a-priori. Therefore, there exists significant scope to take advantage of the benefits of Bayesian optimisation in optimising expensive derivative-free problems, whilst enabling domain experts to inform the decision-making process, putting the human back into the loop.

Many engineering optimization problems can be described as "costly" black box problems, where the number of function evaluations is constrained. Engineers often create precise models of physical systems that are either differentiable or inexpensive to evaluate. These models can be solved efficiently, and their solutions can be applied to the actual system. However, when gradient information or cost-effective models are not available, it becomes necessary to use efficient optimization methods that rely solely on function evaluations - "data". These data-driven optimization algorithms are tailored to optimize functions without relying on explicit derivative information. The methods generally fall into two primary categories: model-based derivative-free methods, also referred to as surrogate-based optimization, and direct derivative-free methods. Model-based methods use information obtained through sampling the objective function to build, consult and update a model of the objective function during optimization. Direct methods navigate the optimization process based on sampled information only. Situated in-between these two categories are the finite-difference methods, which approximate derivatives using function evaluations.
