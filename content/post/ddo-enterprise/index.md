Traditionally, optimization of chemical engineering systems relies on gradients of model expressions. Depending on the effort required to develop accurate models, it might be more efficient to jump the model-building step. Instead, we can use derivative-free optimization (DFO) - also known as black-box or 'data-driven' optimization - for optimal controller tuning, reactor design, experiment design, or flowsheet design based purely on input-output evaluations. This would for example involve the use of Bayesian optimization or trust region methods to iteratively construct and optimize surrogates of the system's input-output evaluations. Rather than use black-box optimization to optimize physical systems or simulations, we can solve complex coordination problems where the black-box evaluations involve optimization problems themselves. The holy grail of process systems operations would be to integrate all decision-making units that arise in the interaction between supply chain players and their hierarchical levels of decision-making. To this end, we can use DFO to determine the coordinating 'complicating' variables in value chain and multi-level hierarchical planning-scheduling-control problems, otherwise determined by heuristics, decomposition techniques, or distributed optimization.
