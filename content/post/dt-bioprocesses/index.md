My work focus on machine learning applications in surrogate modelling, time series prediction, and reinforcement learning process modelling, scheduling, and optimization of bioengineering, has resulted in a unique framework combining kinetic modelling and machine learning for optimizing dynamic systems. At the same time, we apply a novel offline RL framework for optimal bioprocess production scheduling. In contrast to the traditional RL algorithms like temporal difference (TD) learning, we utilise the transformer model to treat the sequential decision-making process through sequential modelling.
