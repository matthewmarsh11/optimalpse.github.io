## Optimization

### Books
- **Numerical Optimization** by J. Nocedal and S. Wright

### Online Courses
- **Convex Optimization I** and **Convex Optimization II** by S. Boyd
  - Great content all over! Lectures 13-19 of COI and all COII are great, and generally underrated. An online book is also available.
- **Discrete Optimization** by P. Van Hentenryck and C. Coffrin from Coursera learning platform
  - Interactive and very fun course to learn discrete optimization.
- **Deterministic Optimization** by S. Ahmed from edX learning platform

## Applied Statistics

### Books
- **Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms** by David MacKay
  - Great all-round book, conceptually clear and at the same time practical when it comes to algorithms. It is great for beginners but also useful for practitioners.
  - Online lectures based on the book also available [here](https://www.inference.org.uk/mackay/itila/) or on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLruBu5BI5n4aFpG32iS0E_g4lTMkKRYGa).
  - The book is freely available [here](https://www.inference.org.uk/itila/book.html).

### Online Courses
- **Bayesian Statistics: From Concept to Data Analysis** by Herbert Lee from Coursera learning platform
  - A great introduction to Bayesian thinking.
- **Bayesian Statistics: Techniques and Models** by Matthew Heiner from Coursera learning platform
  - A continuation from the above course.
- **Bayesian Methods for Machine Learning** by D. Polykovskiy and Al. Novikov
  - Nice practical examples and intuitive explanations on ML algorithms based on Bayesian thinking. Includes topics such as Variational Autoencoder, Gaussian processes & Bayesian optimization.
- **Information Theory, Pattern Recognition, and Neural Networks** by David MacKay
  - Great source to learn information theory, very intuitive and clear explanations.
  - Based on a freely available [book](https://www.inference.org.uk/mackay/itprnn/).

## Dynamic Optimization (Optimal control) and MPC

### Books
- **Dynamic Programming and Optimal Control** by D. P. Bertsekas
  - Nice presentation that shows the relations between Dynamic Programming and Optimal Control. Written from a computer science perspective.
- **Predictive Control: With Constraints** by J. Maciejowski
  - Good introductory material to Model Predictive Control.
- **Numerical Optimal Control** by M. Diehl and S. Gros
  - Great source on how to solve OC problems numerically, goes very well with his online course.
- **Nonlinear and Dynamic Optimization: From Theory to Practice** by B. Chachuat
  - This is a great source for a formal and complete description of dynamic optimization problems in engineering practice. It might be slightly more mathematically demanding than the three previous sources.
- **Model Predictive Control: Theory, Computation, and Design** by J. B. Rawlings, D. Q. Mayne and M. M. Diehl
  - Probably the most complete book on linear MPC, although it might be a difficult read for a beginner in the topic.

### Online Courses
- **Numerical Optimal Control** by M. Diehl
  - Very complete learning material, goes very well with his book.
- **Underactuated Robotics** by R. Tedrake, R. Deits and T. Koolen from edX learning platform
  - A nice course which covers topics on Dynamic Programming, Control and Dynamic Optimization (can also be found [here](http://underactuated.mit.edu/)).
- **Nptel** by the Indian Institutes of Technology (IIT) and Indian Institute of Science (IISc)
  - There are great courses on this site, however, those on Control, State Estimation, Model Predictive Control, and Optimal Control seem particularly good.

## Linear Algebra

### Books
- **Introduction to Linear Algebra** by G. Strang
  - Great presentation and intuition on the topic, goes well with his online video lectures.
- **Linear Algebra** by Jim Hefferon
  - Freely available online, very enjoyable exercises.

### Online Courses
- **Linear Algebra - Foundations to Frontiers** by M. Myers and R. van de Geijn from edX learning platform
  - Great course, gives mathematical background as well as great practical exercises.
- **Linear Algebra** by G. Strang
  - Similar to his book, Linear Algebra is presented in a very intuitive and easy to understand fashion.

## Machine Learning

### Books
- **Deep Learning** by I. Goodfellow, Y. Bengio and A. Courville
  - Authored by pioneers on the field, freely available. Probably the best book on Deep Learning.
- **Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow** by A. Geron
  - For people who want to learn ML by doing practical examples.

### Online Courses
- **Deep Learning Specialization** by Andrew Ng, K. Katanforoosh and B. Mourri from Coursera learning platform
  - A series of 5 courses, that take you from knowing nothing to a very good understanding and practical training on deep learning. Explanations need a minimum mathematical requirement.
- **Machine Learning** by Andrew Ng
  - The course that made Andrew Ng famous. A very nice course, although might be slightly outdated. You can also find his course at Stanford [here](https://see.stanford.edu/Course/CS229).

## Prerequisites

This section outlines useful material that can help polish your math and programming skills before (or while) you are learning optimization and/or machine learning.

- **Linear Algebra**
  - Although there is a whole section about linear algebra, I thought I should emphasize it, as it is one of the pillars for both optimization and machine learning.
- **Python programming**
  - There is a HUGE number of python courses, and even a significant number of online posts ranking the different courses, so a little google search might be the best way to find the best course for you.
  - A course I am confident recommending is [Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-using-python) by MIT on the edX learning platform. Very complete course, although it is quite time consuming.
- **Mathematics for Machine Learning** by Imperial College London
  - A three course specialization, focusing on linear algebra, multivariate calculus, and principal component analysis.
  - Book freely available [here](https://mml-book.github.io/).
- **Algorithms Specialization** by Tim Roughgarden from Stanford at the Coursera platform
  - A very nice course that teaches the fundamentals of the design and analysis of algorithms. Focuses particularly on the practical aspects, but also gives some theory, and makes thinking algorithmically quite fun.

## Remarks

Note that blogs, GitHub repositories, YouTube symposiums, online classes and tutorials can be excellent learning material. Particularly for ML, RL and DL there are new courses and tutorials coming out every day! Maybe worthwhile exploring the web on your own :).

You can have a look at our codes section for some code-tutorials developed by the group, or to our additional resources section, where we list some podcasts, blogs, and other sites that might be of interest.
