      - title: Data-Driven Optimisation
        content: '
  **Fundamentals**
  

  Data-driven optimization concerns itself with the optimization of systems through methodologies that apply the use of data. This may include directly using data to inform the selection of the next set of decision variables to be evaluated, or may include the use of machine learning. Some functions can be computationally expensive, or provide little contextual information outside of a single value. By learning a model of generated data using machine learning, and optimizing this model in-place of the original data-generating system, machine learning-based data-driven optimization techniques can speed up and enhance the optimization of these systems. 


  **Applications**  
 

 Data-driven optimization has been used within the OptiML PSE group in applications spanning planning and scheduling, optimization of simulated chemical reactors, plant-wide optimization and dynamical optimization of bioprocesses. '

      - title: Supply Chain Optimisation
        content: '
**Fundamentals**


Chemical supply chain operations become more and more challenging due to the increasingly stringent economic, environmental and safety considerations of the process industries. Chemical companies use enterprise-wide optimization (EWO) to remain competitive in this harsh business landscape by taking a holistic approach to supply chain optimization. EWO lies at the intersection of chemical engineering and operations research with the ultimate goal of using numerical optimization to integrate and coordinate all decision-making within the enterprise: its various functions (sourcing, manufacturing, distribution); various geographically distributed organizations (plants, markets); and various levels of decision-making (strategic planning to tactical scheduling and operational control). However, the centralized coordination and optimization of interconnected manufacturing and supply chain systems becomes intractable since rigorous accounting of discrete decisions, uncertainty, multiple objectives, and different timescales leads to an explosion in the decision space.  


**Applications**


Our groupâ€™s research explores various data-driven techniques to address some of the shortcomings of EWO. This includes for example: Derivative-Free Optimization (also known as Black-Box or Simulation Optimization) for value chain coordination under organizational considerations, multilevel optimization via derivative-free optimization and optimization with embedded neural network or decision tree surrogates, and Graph Neural Networks for Reinforcement Learning of supply chains. Underlying much of our supply chain optimization runs a strong focus on sustainable supply chain applications and respecting the organizational (i.e. software, privacy, and game-theoretical) considerations of chemical companies.
