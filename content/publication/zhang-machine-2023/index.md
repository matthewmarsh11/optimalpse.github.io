abstract: Over the last decade, there has been a significant shift from traditional
  mechanistic and empirical modelling into statistical and data-driven modelling for
  applications in reaction engineering. In particular, the integration of machine
  learning and first-principle models has demonstrated significant potential and success
  in the discovery of (bio)chemical kinetics, prediction and optimisation of complex
  reactions, and scale-up of industrial reactors.  Summarising the latest research
  and illustrating the current frontiers in applications of hybrid modelling for chemical
  and biochemical reaction engineering, Machine Learning and Hybrid Modelling for
  Reaction Engineering fills a gap in the methodology development of hybrid models.
  With a systematic explanation of the fundamental theory of hybrid model construction,
  time-varying parameter estimation, model structure identification and uncertainty
  analysis, this book is a great resource for both chemical engineers looking to use
  the latest computational techniques in their research and computational chemists
  interested in new applications for their work.
