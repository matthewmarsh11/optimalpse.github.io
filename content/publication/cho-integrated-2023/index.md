abstract: "Biotechnological exploitation of fast-growing cyanobacterial species is\
  \ hindered by unavailable mechanistic interpretations for the differing bioconversion\
  \ rates when exploring strains with similar metabolic pathways and transport systems.\
  \ This study investigated two strains: Synechococcus sp. PCC 11901, the fastest\
  \ growing cyanobacterium identified to date, and Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, under\
  \ a range of operational light intensities from 300 to 900 μmol photons m−2 s−1,\
  \ and presents three original contributions. Firstly, strain specific dynamic biomass\
  \ and optical density (OD750nm) models were constructed incorporating sophisticated\
  \ photo-mechanistic influences, previously unachieved in OD750nm. Secondly, bootstrapping\
  \ parameter estimation with 3-fold cross validations was exploited to simultaneously\
  \ identify the model parameters and confidence intervals, thus enabling probabilistic\
  \ simulations and thorough validation against experimental data sets. Thirdly, presented\
  \ mechanistic interpretations for the over two-fold faster growth of PCC 11901 versus\
  \ PCC 6803 despite PCC 6803's high light utilisation efficiency. These findings\
  \ will benefit upscaling of future cyanobacterial biotechnology applications and\
  \ exploitation of Synechococcus sp. PCC 11901 for production of biomass and chemicals\
  \ of industrial, nutritional and medical importance."
