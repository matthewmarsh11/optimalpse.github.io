abstract: Light attenuation is a primary challenge limiting the upscaling of photobioreactors
  for sustainable bio-production. One key to this challenge, is to model and optimise
  the light/dark cycles so that cells within the dark region can be frequently transferred
  to the light region for photosynthesis. Therefore, this study proposes the first
  mechanistic model to integrate the light/dark cycle effects into biomass growth
  kinetics. This model was initially constructed through theoretical derivation based
  on the intracellular reaction kinetics, and was subsequently modified by embedding
  a new parameter, effective light coefficient, to account for the effects of culture
  mixing. To generate in silico process data, a new multiscale reactive transport
  modelling strategy was developed to couple fluid dynamics with biomass growth kinetics
  and light transmission. By comparing against previous experimental and computational
  studies, the multiscale model shows to be of high accuracy. Based on its simulation
  result, an original correlation was proposed to link effective light coefficient
  with photobioreactor gas inflow rate; this has not been done before. The impact
  of this study is that by using the proposed mechanistic model and correlation, we
  can easily control and optimise photobioreactor gas inflow rates to alleviate light
  attenuation and maintain a high biomass growth rate.
