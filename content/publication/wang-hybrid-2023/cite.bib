 abstract = {One of the main hurdles in the computer-aided design and optimization of industrial bioprocesses is the limited capability of models to accurately represent biosystems. On one hand, mechanistic models have drawbacks in terms of expressing all potential biomechanisms. On the other hand, data-driven models have limited extrapolation ability. Thus, hybrid models may represent the best of both worlds. However, it is challenging to build a hybrid model that can accurately balance its data-driven and first principles components, hence allowing for extrapolation ability and accuracy. In this work, we propose a framework for the development of hybrid models that includes a mechanistic backbone for its construction and judiciously adds the data-driven components. Statistical methods e.g., Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Hannan Quinn Criterion (HQC), are employed to choose the statistically best hybrid model structure. The proposed framework is tested on a simplified microalgae cultivation case study and shows good prediction capabilities under different noise levels, especially by applying BIC for hybrid model selection.},
