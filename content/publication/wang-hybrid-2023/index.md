abstract: One of the main hurdles in the computer-aided design and optimization of
  industrial bioprocesses is the limited capability of models to accurately represent
  biosystems. On one hand, mechanistic models have drawbacks in terms of expressing
  all potential biomechanisms. On the other hand, data-driven models have limited
  extrapolation ability. Thus, hybrid models may represent the best of both worlds.
  However, it is challenging to build a hybrid model that can accurately balance its
  data-driven and first principles components, hence allowing for extrapolation ability
  and accuracy. In this work, we propose a framework for the development of hybrid
  models that includes a mechanistic backbone for its construction and judiciously
  adds the data-driven components. Statistical methods e.g., Bayesian Information
  Criterion (BIC), Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Hannan Quinn Criterion (HQC),
  are employed to choose the statistically best hybrid model structure. The proposed
  framework is tested on a simplified microalgae cultivation case study and shows
  good prediction capabilities under different noise levels, especially by applying
  BIC for hybrid model selection.
