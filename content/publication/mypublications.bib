However, this coordination is often inhibited by expensive, legally-constrained, or proprietary subproblem models. We propose two variations on how model-based (surrogate) derivative-free optimization (DFO) methods can be used to coordinate subproblems with few connecting variables. When these surrogates are convex quadratic, they can be efficiently exploited using semidefinite programming techniques. We compare the performance of these two variations with a distributed optimization solver (ADMM), a model-based, and a direct DFO solver (Py-BOBYQA and DIRECTL). This comparison is done on four variations of an economic-environmental feedstock blending optimization case study. While ADMM seems to display faster initial convergence, explorative DFO optimization solvers seem promising in escaping local minimizers, especially in lower dimensions.},

One key to this challenge, is to model and optimise the light/dark cycles so that cells within the dark region can be frequently transferred to the light region for photosynthesis. Therefore, this study proposes the first mechanistic model to integrate the light/dark cycle effects into biomass growth kinetics. This model was initially constructed through theoretical derivation based on the intracellular reaction kinetics, and was subsequently modified by embedding a new parameter, effective light coefficient, to account for the effects of culture mixing. To generate in silico process data, a new multiscale reactive transport modelling strategy was developed to couple fluid dynamics with biomass growth kinetics and light transmission. By comparing against previous experimental and computational studies, the multiscale model shows to be of high accuracy. Based on its simulation result, an original correlation was proposed to link effective light coefficient with photobioreactor gas inflow rate; this has not been done before. The impact of this study is that by using the proposed mechanistic model and correlation, we can easily control and optimise photobioreactor gas inflow rates to alleviate light attenuation and maintain a high biomass growth rate.},

	abstract = {The industrialization of catalytic processes is of far more importance today than it has ever been before and kinetic models are essential tools for their industrialization. Kinetic models affect the design, the optimization and the control of catalytic processes, but they are not easy to obtain. Classical paradigms, such as mechanistic modeling require substantial domain knowledge, while data-driven and hybrid modeling lack interpretability. Consequently, a different approach called automated knowledge discovery has recently gained popularity. Many methods under this paradigm have been developed, where ALAMO, SINDy and genetic programming are notable examples. However, these methods suffer from important drawbacks: they require assumptions about model structures, scale poorly, lack robust and well-founded model selection routines, and they are sensitive to noise. To overcome these challenges, the present work constructs two methodological frameworks, Automated Discovery of Kinetics using a Strong/Weak formulation of symbolic regression, ADoK-S and ADoK-W, for the automated generation of catalytic kinetic models. We leverage genetic programming for model generation, a sequential optimization routine for model refinement, and a robust criterion for model selection. Both frameworks are tested against three computational case studies of increasing complexity. We showcase their ability to retrieve the underlying kinetic rate model with a limited amount of noisy data from the catalytic system, indicating a strong potential for chemical reaction engineering applications.},

A key enabler of rapid response is having quality-oriented disease-agnostic manufacturing protocols ready ahead of outbreaks. We are the first to apply the Quality by Design (QbD) framework to enhance rapid-response RNA vaccine manufacturing against known and future viral pathogens. This QbD framework aims to support the development and consistent production of safe and efficacious RNA vaccines, integrating a novel qualitative methodology and a quantitative bioprocess model. The qualitative methodology identifies and assesses the direction, magnitude and shape of the impact of critical process parameters (CPPs) on critical quality attributes (CQAs). The mechanistic bioprocess model quantifies and maps the effect of four CPPs on the CQA of effective yield of RNA drug substance. Consequently, the first design space of an RNA vaccine synthesis bioreactor is obtained. The cost-yield optimization together with the probabilistic design space contribute towards automation of rapid-response, high-quality RNA vaccine production.},

This approach updates the coordinated, or shared, variables based on derivative-free optimization (DFO) using only coordinated variables to agent-level optimal subproblem evaluation “data.” We compare the performance of our framework using different DFO solvers (CUATRO, Py-BOBYQA, DIRECT-L, GPyOpt) against conventional distributed optimization (ADMM) on three case studies: collaborative learning, facility location, and multiobjective blending. We show that in low-dimensional and nonconvex subproblems, the exploration-exploitation trade-offs of DFO solvers can be leveraged to converge faster and to a better solution than in distributed optimization.},

Most real dynamic models are however affected by plant-model mismatch and process uncertainties, which can lead to closed-loop performance deterioration and constraint violations. Methods such as stochastic MPC (SMPC) have been proposed to alleviate these problems; however, the resulting closed-loop state trajectory might still significantly violate the prescribed constraints if the real system deviates from the assumed disturbance distributions made during the controller design. In this work we propose a novel data-driven distributionally robust MPC scheme for nonlinear systems. Unlike SMPC, which requires the exact knowledge of the disturbance distribution, our scheme decides the control action with respect to the worst distribution from a distribution ambiguity set. This ambiguity set is defined as a Wasserstein ball centered at the empirical distribution. Due to the potential model errors that cause off-sets, the scheme is also extended by leveraging an offset-free method. The favorable results of this control scheme are demonstrated and empirically verified with a nonlinear mass spring system and a nonlinear CSTR case study.},

	abstract = {Experimental design plays an important role in efficiently acquiring informative data for system characterization and deriving robust conclusions under resource limitations. Recent advancements in high-throughput experimentation coupled with machine learning have notably improved experimental procedures. While Bayesian optimization (BO) has undeniably revolutionized the landscape of optimization in experimental design, especially in the chemical domain, it's important to recognize the role of other surrogate-based approaches within conventional chemistry optimization problems. This is particularly relevant because many chemical problems involve mixed-variable design space with physical constraints, making it challenging for conventional BO approaches to obtain feasible samples during the acquisition step while maintaining exploration capability. In this paper, we demonstrate that integrating mixed-integer optimization strategies is one way to address these challenges effectively. Specifically, we propose the utilization of mixed-integer surrogates and acquisition functions--methods that offer inherent compatibility with problems with discrete and mixed-variable design space. This work focuses on Piecewise Affine Surrogate-based optimization (PWAS), a surrogate model capable of handling mixed-variable problems subject to linear constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in optimizing experimental planning through three case studies, each with a different design space size and numerical complexity: i) optimization of reaction conditions for Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling (fully categorical), ii) optimization of crossed-barrel design to augment mechanical toughness (mixed-integer), and iii) solvent design for enhanced Menschutkin reaction kinetics (mixed-integer and categorical with linear constraints). By benchmarking PWAS against state-of-the-art optimization algorithms, including genetic algorithms and BO variants, we offer insights into the practical applicability of mixed-integer surrogates.},

However, domain experts often possess valuable physical insights that are overlooked in fully automated decision-making approaches, necessitating the inclusion of human input. In this article we re-introduce the human back into the data-driven decision making loop by outlining an approach for collaborative Bayesian optimization. Our methodology exploits the hypothesis that humans are more efficient at making discrete choices rather than continuous ones and enables experts to influence critical early decisions. We apply high-throughput (batch) Bayesian optimization alongside discrete decision theory to enable domain experts to influence the selection of experiments. At every iteration we apply a multi-objective approach that results in a set of alternate solutions that have both high utility and are reasonably distinct. The expert then selects the desired solution for evaluation from this set, allowing for the inclusion of expert knowledge and improving accountability, whilst maintaining the advantages of Bayesian optimization. We demonstrate our approach across a number of applied and numerical case studies including bioprocess optimization and reactor geometry design, demonstrating that even in the case of an uninformed practitioner our algorithm recovers the regret of standard Bayesian optimization. Through the inclusion of continuous expert opinion, our approach enables faster convergence, and improved accountability for Bayesian optimization in engineering systems.},

	abstract = {Bayesian optimization has been successfully applied throughout Chemical Engineering for the optimization of functions that are expensive-to-evaluate, or where gradients are not easily obtainable. However, domain experts often possess valuable physical insights that are overlooked in fully automated decision-making approaches, necessitating the inclusion of human input. In this article we re-introduce the human back into the data-driven decision making loop by outlining an approach for collaborative Bayesian optimization. Our methodology exploits the hypothesis that humans are more efficient at making discrete choices rather than continuous ones and enables experts to influence critical early decisions. We apply high-throughput (batch) Bayesian optimization alongside discrete decision theory to enable domain experts to influence the selection of experiments. At every iteration we apply a multi-objective approach that results in a set of alternate solutions that have both high utility and are reasonably distinct. The expert then selects the desired solution for evaluation from this set, allowing for the inclusion of expert knowledge and improving accountability, whilst maintaining the advantages of Bayesian optimization. We demonstrate our approach across a number of applied and numerical case studies including bioprocess optimization and reactor geometry design, demonstrating that even in the case of an uninformed practitioner our algorithm recovers the regret of standard Bayesian optimization. Through the inclusion of continuous expert opinion, our approach enables faster convergence, and improved accountability for Bayesian optimization in engineering systems.},

Decentralized path planning, which only uses partial observation for each module to make decision is an important problem for real-world task. This article presents partially observable self-reconfiguration path planning, addressing the reconfiguration path planning problem for a single module using partial observations while aiming to maximize the policy learning efficiency. An end-to-end algorithm is proposed by employing a recurrent Q-learning algorithm and a deep neural network, where a Long Short Term Memory network is used to remember useful features from historical observations. Moreover, a 3-D convolutional neural network is used to automatically extract high-level features from observation data and is shown to significantly increase the learning efficiency.

Unaddressed challenges, particularly the absence of robust evaluation metrics for performance comparison, and the lack of black-box interpretability, obscure model limitations and impede progress in the field. We present an automated benchmarking pipeline designed for effective model performance comparisons. With an emphasis on user-friendly design, we aim to streamline accessibility and facilitate utilisation within the research community. Additionally, we suggest and perform a new interpretability study to uncover the degree of chemical understanding acquired by retrosynthesis models. Our results reveal that frameworks based on chemical reaction rules yield the most diverse, chemically valid, and feasible reactions, whereas purely data-driven frameworks suffer from unfeasible and invalid predictions. The interpretability study emphasises that incorporating reaction rules not only enhances model performance but also improves interpretability. For simple molecules, we demonstrate that Graph Neural Networks identify relevant functional groups within the product molecule, providing thermodynamic stabilisation over the reactant precursors. In contrast, the popular Transformer fails to identify such crucial stabilisation. As the molecule and reaction mechanism grow more complex, both data-driven models propose unfeasible disconnections without offering a chemical rationale. We stress the importance of incorporating chemically meaningful descriptors within deep-learning models. Our study provides valuable guidance for the future development of retrosynthesis frameworks.},

Within our framework, DARTS, we derive a novel criteria for dictating optimization termination, ensuring a high fidelity solution is returned before budget is exhausted. We investigate the design of helical-tube reactors under pulsed-flow conditions, which have demonstrated outstanding mixing characteristics. To validate our results, we 3D print and experimentally validate the optimal reactor geometry, confirming mixing performance.

Traditionally, their integration is modelled sequentially, but recent efforts prioritize lower-level feasibility and optimality, leading to large-scale, potentially multi-level, hierarchical formulations. Data-driven techniques, like optimality surrogates or derivative-free optimization, become essential in addressing ensuing tractability challenges. We demonstrate a step-by-step workflow to find a tractable solution to a tri-level formulation of a multi-site, multi-product planning-scheduling-control case study. We discuss solution tractability-accuracy trade-offs and scaling properties for both methods. Despite individual improvements over conventional heuristics, both approaches present drawbacks. Consequently, we synthesize our findings into a methodology combining their strengths. Our approach remains agnostic to the level-specific formulations when the linking variables are identified and retains the heuristic sequential solution as fallback option. We advance the field by leveraging parallelization, hyperparameter tuning, and a combination of off- and on-line computation, to find tractable solutions to more accurate multi-level formulations.},

One such versatile flow chemistry platform is the coiled tube reactor subjected to oscillatory motion, producing excellent plug flow qualities equivalent to well-mixed tanks-in-series ‘N’. In this study, we discover the critical features of these flows that result in high plug flow performance using a data-driven approach. This is done by integrating Bayesian optimisation, a surrogate model approach, with Computational fluid dynamics that we treat as a black-box function to explore the parameter space of the operating conditions, oscillation amplitude and frequency, and net flow rate. Here, we correlate the flow characteristics as a function of the dimensionless Strouhal, oscillatory Dean, and Reynolds numbers to the reactor plug flow performance value ‘N’. Under conditions of optimal performance (specific examples are provided herein), the oscillatory flow is just sufficient to limit axial dispersion through flow reversal and redirection, and to promote Dean vortices. This automated, open-source, integrated method can be easily adapted to identify the flow characteristics that produce an optimised performance for other chemical reactors and processes.},

	abstract = {Real-Time Optimization (RTO) plays a crucial role in the process operation hierarchy by determining optimal set-points for the lower-level controllers. However, at the control layer, these set-points may be difficult to track due to challenges in implementation as a result of disturbances, measurement noise, and actuator performance limitations. To address this, in this paper, we present the Adversarially Robust Real-Time Optimization and Control (ARRTOC) algorithm. ARRTOC addresses this issue by finding set-points which are both optimal and inherently robust to implementation errors at the control layers. ARRTOC draws inspiration from adversarial machine learning, offering a novel constrained Adversarially Robust Optimization (ARO) solution applied to the RTO layer. By integrating controller design with RTO, ARRTOC enhances overall system performance and robustness by ensuring the chosen set-points are tailored to the underlying controller designs. To validate our claims, we present three case studies: an illustrative example, a bioreactor case study, and a multi-loop evaporator process. The proposed approach is found to improve RTO objectives, such as profit, by as much as \$50{\textbackslash}\%\$ in some case studies compared to RTO formulations which ignore the performance of the control layers.},

We associate the development of mixing-enhancing vortical flow structures in novel coiled reactors with performance, and use our approach to identify key characteristics of optimal designs.

	abstract = {Most solutions to the inventory management problem assume a centralization of information that is incompatible with organisational constraints in real supply chain networks. The inventory management problem is a well-known planning problem in operations research, concerned with finding the optimal re-order policy for nodes in a supply chain. While many centralized solutions to the problem exist, they are not applicable to real-world supply chains made up of independent entities. The problem can however be naturally decomposed into sub-problems, each associated with an independent entity, turning it into a multi-agent system. Therefore, a decentralized data-driven solution to inventory management problems using multi-agent reinforcement learning is proposed where each entity is controlled by an agent. Three multi-agent variations of the proximal policy optimization algorithm are investigated through simulations of different supply chain networks and levels of uncertainty. The centralized training decentralized execution framework is deployed, which relies on offline centralization during simulation-based policy identification, but enables decentralization when the policies are deployed online to the real system. Results show that using multi-agent proximal policy optimization with a centralized critic leads to performance very close to that of a centralized data-driven solution and outperforms a distributed model-based solution in most cases while respecting the information constraints of the system.},

A statistical learning bound is provided to validate the ambiguity set. For this control problem, polytopic hard input constraints and state chance constraints are considered. State chance constraints are formulated into linear deterministic constraints through solving a DR optimization problem with Wasserstein ambiguity set. The resulting optimal control problem can be equivalently solved by a linear program. We prove recursive feasibility and provide an average asymptotic cost bound for the corresponding MPC framework.

	abstract = {Ongoing risks from climate change have significantly impacted the livelihood of global nomadic communities and are likely to lead to increased migratory movements in coming years. As a result, mobility considerations are becoming increasingly important in energy systems planning, particularly to achieve energy access in developing countries. Advanced “Plug and Play” control strategies have been recently developed with such a decentralized framework in mind, allowing easier interconnection of nomadic communities, both to each other and to the main grid. Considering the above, the design and planning strategy of a mobile multi-energy supply system for a nomadic community is investigated in this work. Motivated by the scale and dimensionality of the associated uncertainties, impacting all major design and decision variables over the 30-year planning horizon, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) Flexibility Analysis is implemented for the design and planning problem. DRL based solutions are benchmarked against several rigid baseline design options to compare expected performance under uncertainty. The results on a case study for ger communities in Mongolia suggest that mobile nomadic energy systems can be both technically and economically feasible, particularly when considering flexibility, although the degree of spatial dispersion among households is an important limiting factor. Additionally, the DRL based policies lead to the development of dynamic evolution and adaptability strategies, which can be used by the targeted communities under a very wide range of potential scenarios. Key economic, sustainability and resilience indicators such as Cost, Equivalent Emissions and Total Unmet Load are measured, suggesting potential improvements compared to available baselines of up to 25\%, 67\% and 76\%, respectively. Finally, the decomposition of values of flexibility and plug and play operation is presented using a variation of real options theory, with important implications for both nomadic communities and policymakers focused on enabling their energy access.},

This renders the control and optimization of such systems a complex task owing to their nonlinear behaviour. Standard methods of dealing with nonlinear systems such as linearizing around a fixed point may not be an effective strategy for many systems, thus requiring an alternative approach. For this reason, we propose a novel deep learning framework to discover a transformation of a nonlinear dynamical system to an equivalent higher dimensional linear system using data generated from identification experiments. We demonstrate that the resulting learned linear representation accurately captures the dynamics of the original system for a wide range of conditions defined by the training dataset used. As a result of this, we show that the learned linear model can subsequently be used for the successful control of the original system. We demonstrate this by applying the proposed framework to three examples; a benchmark example from the literature, and two practical, complex nonlinear dynamical systems from the chemical engineering domain: the Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR) system and finally the four-tank system.},

	abstract = {Integrating physical knowledge and machine learning is a cost-efficient solution to modelling complex biochemical processes when the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. However, hybrid model structure identification is still time-consuming for new processes, ruiring iteration over different hypotheses to explain the observed process dynamics while minimizing over-parameterization. Unfortunately, conventional approaches to automatic model structure identification do not always converge for highly nonlinear models and cannot estimate time-varying model parameters. To address this and accelerate the design of new biochemical processes, a Reinforcement Learning (RL) based framework recently reformulated synchronous hybrid model structure-parameter identification into a process optimal control problem. To further investigate other possible solutions, in this study, a novel Physics Informed Neural Network (PINN) based framework was proposed for the first time to infer time-varying kinetic parameters. This framework first combines possible kinetic structures from phenomenological knowledge, then simultaneously identifies the most likely hybrid model structure and time-varying parameter trajectories. To demonstrate the performance of the PINN based framework, several in-silico case studies were conducted using a known ground truth bioprocess. We thoroughly examined the advantages and limitations of the framework, elucidating its potential for high-fidelity hybrid model construction in biochemical engineering research.},

Thus, hybrid models may represent the best of both worlds. However, it is challenging to build a hybrid model that can accurately balance its data-driven and first principles components, hence allowing for extrapolation ability and accuracy. In this work, we propose a framework for the development of hybrid models that includes a mechanistic backbone for its construction and judiciously adds the data-driven components.

This is achieved by leveraging a linear plant model and feedback from measurements. However the presence of plant-model mismatch leads to suboptimal results when using this approach. Learning the plant-model mismatch enables Online Feedback Optimization to overcome this shortcoming. In this work we present a novel application of Online Feedback Optimization with online model adaptation using Gaussian process regression. We demonstrate our approach with a realistic load sharing problem in a compressor station with parametric and structural plant-model mismatch. We assume imperfect knowledge of the compressor maps and design an Online Feedback Optimization controller that minimizes the compressor station power consumption. In the evaluated scenario, imperfect knowledge of the plant leads to a 5\% increase in power consumption compared to the case with perfect knowledge. We demonstrate that Online Feedback Optimization with model adaptation reduces this increase to only 0.8\%, closely approximating the case of perfect knowledge of the plant, regardless of the type of mismatch.},

	abstract = {Integrating post-combustion carbon capture and storage (CCS) facilities into fossil fuel power plants is considered an important step for reaching global carbon emission reduction targets. When the number of gas analyzers in such CCS units is limited, variations in the load of the power plant pose a challenge to determine the gaseous CO2 concentration profile in the absorber. A dynamic hybrid model for estimating the carbon capture absorber’s gaseous CO2 concentration profile has been proposed in this study. The model is built using actual process data collected from a carbon capture pilot plant and it combines data-driven and reaction kinetic (mechanistic) modeling approaches to act as a soft sensor along the absorber column. A subset of the process data is used for training the data-driven models and for estimating the parameters of the mechanistic model respectively. Dimensionality reduction techniques are applied to the data-driven model to reduce the input size and hence the size of the dynamic model elements. The outputs of the two models are fused by comparing the computed covariance matrices. A particular challenge for this work is that the collected process data has missing spatial labels and temporal values for the CO2 concentration measurements. The presented models are obtained using an encoding and interpolation approach for the missing information. For comparison, an alternative approach based on semi-supervised learning has been implemented. The performance of the resulting soft sensors is verified by using process data from previously unseen operating conditions. The soft sensor based on the proposed hybrid model outperforms the soft sensor trained by semi-supervised autoencoder. Overall the results indicate that the proposed approach can estimate the CO2 concentration percentage with an average root mean squared error of 0.123.},

Optimizing the geometry of the next generation of chemical reactors is important to understand the underlying physics and to ensure reactor feasibility in the real world.

In this work, we apply deep Gaussian processes (DGPs) to model multi-fidelity coiled-tube reactor simulations in a Bayesian optimization setting. By applying a multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization method, the search space of reactor geometries is explored through an amalgam of different fidelity simulations which are chosen based on prediction uncertainty and simulation cost, maximizing the use of computational budget. The use of DGPs provides an end-to-end model for five discrete mesh fidelities, enabling less computational effort to gain good solutions during optimization. The accuracy of simulations for these five fidelities is determined against experimental data obtained from a 3D printed reactor configuration, providing insights into appropriate hyper-parameters. We hope this work provides interesting insight into the practical use of DGP-based multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization for engineering discovery.},

When comparing different process designs, for the comparison to be meaningful, each design must involve its optimal operation. Therefore, to optimize a process’ design, one must address design and control simultaneously. For this, one can formulate a bilevel optimization problem, with the design as the outer problem in the form of a mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP) and a stochastic optimal control as the inner problem. This is intractable by most approaches. In this paper we propose to compute the optimal control using reinforcement learning, and then embed this controller into the design problem. This allows to decouple the solution procedure, while having the same optimal result as if solving the bilevel problem. The approach is tested in two case studies and the performance of the controller is evaluated. The case studies indicate that the proposed approach outperforms current state-of-the-art simultaneous design and control strategies.

We consider commonly imposed restrictions on these problems such as precedence and disjunctive constraints which are not naturally considered by RL in other contexts. Additionally, this work naturally enables the optimization of risk-sensitive formulations such as the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR), which are essential in realistic scheduling processes. The proposed strategy is investigated thoroughly in a parallel batch production environment, and benchmarked against mixed integer linear programming (MILP) strategies. We show that the policy identified by our approach is able to account for plant uncertainties in online decision-making, with expected performance comparable to existing MILP methods. Additionally, the framework gains the benefits of optimizing for risk-sensitive measures, and identifies online decisions orders of magnitude faster than the most efficient optimization approaches.

            Predictive modeling of new biochemical systems with small data is a great challenge. To fill this gap, transfer learning, a subdomain of machine learning that serves to transfer knowledge from a generalized model to a more domain‐specific model, provides a promising solution. While transfer learning has been used in natural language processing, image analysis, and chemical engineering fault detection, its application within biochemical engineering has not been systematically explored. In this study, we demonstrated the benefits of transfer learning when applied to predict dynamic behaviors of new biochemical processes. Two different case studies were presented to investigate the accuracy, reliability, and advantage of this innovative modeling approach. We thoroughly discussed the different transfer learning strategies and the effects of topology on transfer learning, comparing the performance of the transfer learning models against benchmark kinetic and data‐driven models. Furthermore, strong connections between the underlying process mechanism and the transfer learning model's optimal structure were highlighted, suggesting the interpretability of transfer learning to enable more accurate prediction than a naive data‐driven modeling approach. Therefore, this study shows a novel approach to effectively combining data from different resources for bioprocess simulation.},

	abstract = {Predictive modeling of new biochemical systems with small data is a great challenge. To fill this gap, transfer learning, a subdomain of machine learning that serves to transfer knowledge from a generalized model to a more domain-specific model, provides a promising solution. While transfer learning has been used in natural language processing, image analysis, and chemical engineering fault detection, its application within biochemical engineering has not been systematically explored. In this study, we demonstrated the benefits of transfer learning when applied to predict dynamic behaviors of new biochemical processes. Two different case studies were presented to investigate the accuracy, reliability, and advantage of this innovative modeling approach. We thoroughly discussed the different transfer learning strategies and the effects of topology on transfer learning, comparing the performance of the transfer learning models against benchmark kinetic and data-driven models. Furthermore, strong connections between the underlying process mechanism and the transfer learning model's optimal structure were highlighted, suggesting the interpretability of transfer learning to enable more accurate prediction than a naive data-driven modeling approach. Therefore, this study shows a novel approach to effectively combining data from different resources for bioprocess simulation.},

	abstract = {A data-driven MPC scheme is proposed to safely control constrained stochastic linear systems using distributionally robust optimization. Distributionally robust constraints based on the Wasserstein metric are imposed to bound the state constraint violations in the presence of process disturbance. A feedback control law is solved to guarantee that the predicted states comply with constraints. The stochastic constraints are satisfied with regard to the worst-case distribution within the Wasserstein ball centered at their discrete empirical probability distribution. The resulting distributionally robust MPC framework is computationally tractable and efficient, as well as recursively feasible. The innovation of this approach is that all the information about the uncertainty can be determined empirically from the data. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated through numerical case studies.},

	abstract = {Reinforcement learning (RL) is a control approach that can handle nonlinear stochastic optimal control problems. However, despite the promise exhibited, RL has yet to see marked translation to industrial practice primarily due to its inability to satisfy state constraints. In this work we aim to address this challenge. We propose an “oracle”-assisted constrained Q-learning algorithm that guarantees the satisfaction of joint chance constraints with a high probability, which is crucial for safety critical tasks. To achieve this, constraint tightening (backoffs) are introduced and adjusted using Broyden’s method, hence making the backoffs self-tuned. This results in a methodology that can be imbued into RL algorithms to ensure constraint satisfaction. We analyze the performance of the proposed approach and compare against nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC). The favorable performance of this algorithm signifies a step towards the incorporation of RL into real world optimization and control of engineering systems, where constraints are essential.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a new class of real-time optimization schemes to overcome system-model mismatch of uncertain processes. This work’s novelty lies on integrating derivative-free optimization schemes and multi-fidelity Gaussian processes within a Bayesian optimization framework. The proposed scheme uses two Gaussian processes for the stochastic system, one emulates the (known) process model, and another, the true system though measurements. In this way, low fidelity samples can be obtained via a model, while high fidelity samples are obtained through measurements of the system. This framework captures the system’s behavior in a non-parametric fashion, while driving exploration through acquisition functions. The benefit of using a Gaussian process to represent the system is the ability to perform uncertainty quantification in real-time and allow for chance constraints to be satisfied with high confidence. This results in a practical approach that is illustrated in numerical case studies, including a semi-batch photobioreactor optimization problem.},
