abstract: In this paper, surrogate modelling and optimization is investigated for
  use in large scale chemical processes. A novel CryoMan cascade liquefied natural
  gas (LNG) refrigeration cycle is selected as the case study which has been highlighted
  for potential use within industry. Given its high nonlinearity and dimensionality
  (31 input variables and 20 output variables with a number of physical constraints)
  and short time horizon for real-time decision-making, an time-efficient optimization
  scheme must be developed to maximize process performance. Therefore, various supervised
  and unsupervised learning techniques as well as surrogate model structures are explored
  in order to accurately capture the behaviour of this highly complex and interrelated
  process flowsheet. Optimal solutions identified by the surrogate models are validated
  against the rigorous process model. Following from the challenges encountered by
  artificial neural network based surrogate models, Gaussian processes were adopted
  and combined with partial least squares to simultaneously reduce dimensionality
  and capture the nonlinearity of the underlying chemical process. Through this innovative
  surrogate modelling strategy, overall time to optimize the LNG production process
  was reduced by orders of magnitude compared to the rigorous model based optimization
  methodology, hence significantly facilitating the industrial application of this
  new process.
