abstract: Ongoing risks from climate change have significantly impacted the livelihood
  of global nomadic communities and are likely to lead to increased migratory movements
  in coming years. As a result, mobility considerations are becoming increasingly
  important in energy systems planning, particularly to achieve energy access in developing
  countries. Advanced “Plug and Play” control strategies have been recently developed
  with such a decentralized framework in mind, allowing easier interconnection of
  nomadic communities, both to each other and to the main grid. Considering the above,
  the design and planning strategy of a mobile multi-energy supply system for a nomadic
  community is investigated in this work. Motivated by the scale and dimensionality
  of the associated uncertainties, impacting all major design and decision variables
  over the 30-year planning horizon, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) Flexibility
  Analysis is implemented for the design and planning problem. DRL based solutions
  are benchmarked against several rigid baseline design options to compare expected
  performance under uncertainty. The results on a case study for ger communities in
  Mongolia suggest that mobile nomadic energy systems can be both technically and
  economically feasible, particularly when considering flexibility, although the degree
  of spatial dispersion among households is an important limiting factor. Additionally,
  the DRL based policies lead to the development of dynamic evolution and adaptability
  strategies, which can be used by the targeted communities under a very wide range
  of potential scenarios. Key economic, sustainability and resilience indicators such
  as Cost, Equivalent Emissions and Total Unmet Load are measured, suggesting potential
  improvements compared to available baselines of up to 25%, 67% and 76%, respectively.
  Finally, the decomposition of values of flexibility and plug and play operation
  is presented using a variation of real options theory, with important implications
  for both nomadic communities and policymakers focused on enabling their energy access.
