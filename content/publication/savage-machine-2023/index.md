abstract: Additive manufacturing has enabled the fabrication of advanced reactor geometries,
  permitting larger, more complex design spaces. Identifying promising configurations
  within such spaces presents a significant challenge for current approaches. Furthermore,
  existing parameterisations of reactor geometries are low-dimensional with expensive
  optimisation limiting more complex solutions. To address this challenge, we establish
  a machine learning-assisted approach for the design of the next-generation of chemical
  reactors, combining the application of high-dimensional parameterisations, computational
  fluid dynamics, and multi-fidelity Bayesian optimisation. We associate the development
  of mixing-enhancing vortical flow structures in novel coiled reactors with performance,
  and use our approach to identify key characteristics of optimal designs. By appealing
  to fluid mechanical principles, we rationalise the selection of novel design features
  that lead to experimental performance improvements of ~60% over conventional designs.
  Our results demonstrate that coupling advanced manufacturing techniques with `augmented-intelligence'
  approaches can lead to superior design performance and, consequently, emissions-reduction
  and sustainability.
