abstract: Predictive modeling of new biochemical systems with small data is a great
  challenge. To fill this gap, transfer learning, a subdomain of machine learning
  that serves to transfer knowledge from a generalized model to a more domain-specific
  model, provides a promising solution. While transfer learning has been used in natural
  language processing, image analysis, and chemical engineering fault detection, its
  application within biochemical engineering has not been systematically explored.
  In this study, we demonstrated the benefits of transfer learning when applied to
  predict dynamic behaviors of new biochemical processes. Two different case studies
  were presented to investigate the accuracy, reliability, and advantage of this innovative
  modeling approach. We thoroughly discussed the different transfer learning strategies
  and the effects of topology on transfer learning, comparing the performance of the
  transfer learning models against benchmark kinetic and data-driven models. Furthermore,
  strong connections between the underlying process mechanism and the transfer learning
  model's optimal structure were highlighted, suggesting the interpretability of transfer
  learning to enable more accurate prediction than a naive data-driven modeling approach.
  Therefore, this study shows a novel approach to effectively combining data from
  different resources for bioprocess simulation.
