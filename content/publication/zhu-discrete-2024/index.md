abstract: "Experimental design plays an important role in efficiently acquiring informative\
  \ data for system characterization and deriving robust conclusions under resource\
  \ limitations. Recent advancements in high-throughput experimentation coupled with\
  \ machine learning have notably improved experimental procedures. While Bayesian\
  \ optimization (BO) has undeniably revolutionized the landscape of optimization\
  \ in experimental design, especially in the chemical domain, it's important to recognize\
  \ the role of other surrogate-based approaches within conventional chemistry optimization\
  \ problems. This is particularly relevant because many chemical problems involve\
  \ mixed-variable design space with physical constraints, making it challenging for\
  \ conventional BO approaches to obtain feasible samples during the acquisition step\
  \ while maintaining exploration capability. In this paper, we demonstrate that integrating\
  \ mixed-integer optimization strategies is one way to address these challenges effectively.\
  \ Specifically, we propose the utilization of mixed-integer surrogates and acquisition\
  \ functions--methods that offer inherent compatibility with problems with discrete\
  \ and mixed-variable design space. This work focuses on Piecewise Affine Surrogate-based\
  \ optimization (PWAS), a surrogate model capable of handling mixed-variable problems\
  \ subject to linear constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach\
  \ in optimizing experimental planning through three case studies, each with a different\
  \ design space size and numerical complexity: i) optimization of reaction conditions\
  \ for Suzukiâ€“Miyaura cross-coupling (fully categorical), ii) optimization of crossed-barrel\
  \ design to augment mechanical toughness (mixed-integer), and iii) solvent design\
  \ for enhanced Menschutkin reaction kinetics (mixed-integer and categorical with\
  \ linear constraints). By benchmarking PWAS against state-of-the-art optimization\
  \ algorithms, including genetic algorithms and BO variants, we offer insights into\
  \ the practical applicability of mixed-integer surrogates."
