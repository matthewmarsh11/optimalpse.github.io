abstract: 'Neural ordinary differential equations (Neural ODEs) define continuous
  time dynamical systems with neural networks. The interest in their application for
  modelling has sparked recently, spanning hybrid system identification problems and
  time series analysis. In this work we propose the use of a neural control policy
  capable of satisfying state and control constraints to solve nonlinear optimal control
  problems. The control policy optimization is posed as a Neural ODE problem to efficiently
  exploit the availability of a dynamical system model. We showcase the efficacy of
  this type of deterministic neural policies in two constrained systems: the controlled
  Van der Pol system and a bioreactor control problem. This approach represents a
  practical approximation to the intractable closed-loop solution of nonlinear control
  problems.'
