abstract: The field of machine learning is comprised of techniques, which have proven
  powerful approaches to knowledge discovery and construction of ‘digital twins’ in
  the highly dimensional, nonlinear and stochastic domains common to biochemical engineering.
  We review the use of machine learning within biochemical engineering over the last
  20 years. The most prevalent machine learning methods are demystified, and their
  impact across individual biochemical engineering subfields is outlined. In doing
  so we provide insights into the true benefits of each technique, and obstacles for
  their wider deployment. Finally, core challenges into the application of machine
  learning in biochemical engineering are thoroughly discussed, and further insight
  into adoption of innovative hybrid modelling and transfer learning strategies for
  development of new digital biotechnologies is provided.
