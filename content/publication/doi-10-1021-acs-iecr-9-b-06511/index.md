abstract: ' Biomass-derived polymer production processes have been extensively studied
  to substitute petrochemical-based polymer synthesis routes. However, previous research
  predominantly focused on the synthesis of nitrogen-free polymers. Therefore, a novel
  superstructure reaction network was constructed in this study to convert different
  types of biomass waste into a range of commercial nitrogen-containing polymers.
  Trade-offs between process profit and greenness were analyzed to screen the large
  size of bioderived reaction pathways. Both mixed-integer programming and multiobjective
  optimization were formulated to effectively identify the best polymer candidates
  and their associated optimal synthesis route. Several commercial nitrogen-containing
  polymers including urea-formaldehyde and Nylon 1,6 were found to be promising candidates
  for future bioproduction. Moreover, the stability of current optimization results
  with respect to the availability of external nitrogen and hydrogen sources was also
  thoroughly analyzed. The results of this study can be used to guide the development
  of future renewable polymer production processes. '
