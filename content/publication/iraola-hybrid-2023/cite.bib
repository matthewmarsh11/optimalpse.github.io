 abstract = {In this work we present a hybrid monitoring approach for fault detection using the Tennessee Eastman (TE) process. We benchmark our proposed approach against previous methods in the available literature and analyze the benefits and shortcomings. The hybrid monitoring approach contains two steps. First, from a model-based perspective, a dynamic model of the TE plant is constructed using commercial dynamic simulation software and data is generated from the TE plant and its model. In the second step, a data-driven analysis is conducted. This involves training different fault detection models with the previously obtained datasets to detect plant faults as early as possible. The results show that combining datasets can improve the traditional pure data-driven monitoring performance with only plant data. This work highlights the usefulness of combining process modeling and machine learning in the monitoring and prognostics fields when data availability from the actual process is limited.},
