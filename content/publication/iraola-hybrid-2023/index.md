abstract: In this work we present a hybrid monitoring approach for fault detection
  using the Tennessee Eastman (TE) process. We benchmark our proposed approach against
  previous methods in the available literature and analyze the benefits and shortcomings.
  The hybrid monitoring approach contains two steps. First, from a model-based perspective,
  a dynamic model of the TE plant is constructed using commercial dynamic simulation
  software and data is generated from the TE plant and its model. In the second step,
  a data-driven analysis is conducted. This involves training different fault detection
  models with the previously obtained datasets to detect plant faults as early as
  possible. The results show that combining datasets can improve the traditional pure
  data-driven monitoring performance with only plant data. This work highlights the
  usefulness of combining process modeling and machine learning in the monitoring
  and prognostics fields when data availability from the actual process is limited.
