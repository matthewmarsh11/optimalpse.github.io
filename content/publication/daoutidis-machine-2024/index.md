abstract: This “white paper” is a concise perspective of the potential of machine
  learning in the process systems engineering (PSE) domain, based on a session during
  FIPSE 5, held in Crete, Greece, June 27–29, 2022. The session included two invited
  talks and three short contributed presentations followed by extensive discussions.
  This paper does not intend to provide a comprehensive review on the subject or a
  detailed exposition of the discussions; instead its aim is to distill the main points
  of the discussions and talks, and in doing so, highlight open problems and directions
  for future research. The general conclusion from the session was that machine learning
  can have a transformational impact on the PSE domain enabling new discoveries and
  innovations, but research is needed to develop domain-specific techniques for problems
  in molecular/material design, data analytics, optimization, and control.
