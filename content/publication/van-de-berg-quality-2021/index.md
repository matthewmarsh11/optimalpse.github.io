abstract: Rapid-response vaccine production platform technologies, including RNA vaccines,
  are being developed to combat viral epidemics and pandemics. A key enabler of rapid
  response is having quality-oriented disease-agnostic manufacturing protocols ready
  ahead of outbreaks. We are the first to apply the Quality by Design (QbD) framework
  to enhance rapid-response RNA vaccine manufacturing against known and future viral
  pathogens. This QbD framework aims to support the development and consistent production
  of safe and efficacious RNA vaccines, integrating a novel qualitative methodology
  and a quantitative bioprocess model. The qualitative methodology identifies and
  assesses the direction, magnitude and shape of the impact of critical process parameters
  (CPPs) on critical quality attributes (CQAs). The mechanistic bioprocess model quantifies
  and maps the effect of four CPPs on the CQA of effective yield of RNA drug substance.
  Consequently, the first design space of an RNA vaccine synthesis bioreactor is obtained.
  The cost-yield optimization together with the probabilistic design space contribute
  towards automation of rapid-response, high-quality RNA vaccine production.
