 abstract = {The industrialization of catalytic processes is of far more importance today than it has ever been before and kinetic models are essential tools for their industrialization. Kinetic models affect the design, the optimization and the control of catalytic processes, but they are not easy to obtain. Classical paradigms, such as mechanistic modeling require substantial domain knowledge, while data-driven and hybrid modeling lack interpretability. Consequently, a different approach called automated knowledge discovery has recently gained popularity. Many methods under this paradigm have been developed, where ALAMO, SINDy and genetic programming are notable examples. However, these methods suffer from important drawbacks: they require assumptions about model structures, scale poorly, lack robust and well-founded model selection routines, and they are sensitive to noise. To overcome these challenges, the present work constructs two methodological frameworks, Automated Discovery of Kinetics using a Strong/Weak formulation of symbolic regression, ADoK-S and ADoK-W, for the automated generation of catalytic kinetic models. We leverage genetic programming for model generation, a sequential optimization routine for model refinement, and a robust criterion for model selection. Both frameworks are tested against three computational case studies of increasing complexity. We showcase their ability to retrieve the underlying kinetic rate model with a limited amount of noisy data from the catalytic system, indicating a strong potential for chemical reaction engineering applications.},
