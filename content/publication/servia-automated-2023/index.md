abstract: 'The industrialization of catalytic processes is of far more importance
  today than it has ever been before and kinetic models are essential tools for their
  industrialization. Kinetic models affect the design, the optimization and the control
  of catalytic processes, but they are not easy to obtain. Classical paradigms, such
  as mechanistic modeling require substantial domain knowledge, while data-driven
  and hybrid modeling lack interpretability. Consequently, a different approach called
  automated knowledge discovery has recently gained popularity. Many methods under
  this paradigm have been developed, where ALAMO, SINDy and genetic programming are
  notable examples. However, these methods suffer from important drawbacks: they require
  assumptions about model structures, scale poorly, lack robust and well-founded model
  selection routines, and they are sensitive to noise. To overcome these challenges,
  the present work constructs two methodological frameworks, Automated Discovery of
  Kinetics using a Strong/Weak formulation of symbolic regression, ADoK-S and ADoK-W,
  for the automated generation of catalytic kinetic models. We leverage genetic programming
  for model generation, a sequential optimization routine for model refinement, and
  a robust criterion for model selection. Both frameworks are tested against three
  computational case studies of increasing complexity. We showcase their ability to
  retrieve the underlying kinetic rate model with a limited amount of noisy data from
  the catalytic system, indicating a strong potential for chemical reaction engineering
  applications.'
