abstract: Dynamic flux analysis methods have been widely used for deciphering complex
  metabolic fluxes transients. However, many of them require frequent experimental
  measurements and are ineffective in dealing with under-determined metabolic reaction
  networks. In this study, we addressed these challenges by (i) integrating a macroscale
  kinetic model with its dynamic metabolic flux model to enable flux simulation over
  the entire time course for batch operation, and (ii) constructing a single-level
  mixed-integer quadratic program (MIQP) to automatically identify the shortest metabolic
  pathways from substrate inflow to biosynthesis of biomass and desired bioproducts.
  To demonstrate the advantages of the proposed framework, a X. dendrorhous fermentation
  process for astaxanthin production was utilised as the case study. It is found that
  the current framework is able to efficiently identify essential pathways and reduce
  the size of the original metabolic network by 70% with negligible computational
  cost. Furthermore, the modelling consistency, robustness, and limitation of this
  framework were thoroughly investigated. This research provides a new avenue for
  efficient in-silico design, analysis, and gene knockout of microbial strains for
  bioproduct synthesis.
