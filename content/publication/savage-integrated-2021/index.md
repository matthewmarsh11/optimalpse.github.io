abstract: Abstract With liquefied natural gas becoming increasingly prevalent as a
  flexible source of energy, the design and optimization of industrial refrigeration
  cycles becomes even more important. In this article, we propose an integrated surrogate
  modeling and optimization framework to model and optimize the complex CryoMan Cascade
  refrigeration cycle. Dimensionality reduction techniques are used to reduce the
  large number of process decision variables which are subsequently supplied to an
  array of Gaussian processes, modeling both the process objective as well as feasibility
  constraints. Through iterative resampling of the rigorous model, this data‐driven
  surrogate is continually refined and subsequently optimized. This approach was not
  only able to improve on the results of directly optimizing the process flow sheet
  but also located the set of optimal operating conditions in only 2 h as opposed
  to the original 3 weeks, facilitating its use in the operational optimization and
  enhanced process design of large‐scale industrial chemical systems.
