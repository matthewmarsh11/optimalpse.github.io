abstract: Neural ordinary differential equations (Neural ODEs) define continuous time
  dynamical systems with neural networks. The interest in their application for modelling
  has sparked recently, spanning hybrid system identification problems and time series
  analysis. In this work we propose the use of a neural control policy capable of
  satisfying state and control constraints to solve nonlinear optimal control problems.
  The control policy optimization is posed as a Neural ODE problem to efficiently
  exploit the availability of a dynamical system model. We showcase the efficacy of
  this type of deterministic neural policies in the controlled Van der Pol system.
  This approach represents a practical approximation to the intractable closed-loop
  solution of nonlinear control problems.
