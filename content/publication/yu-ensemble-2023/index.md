abstract: The emergence of Quality by Design (QbD) and Process Analytical Technology
  (PAT) paradigm supported by the FDA imposes a strong motivation for digital transformation
  in biopharmaceutical industry. The inherent complexity of bioprocess dynamics, batch-to-batch
  variability resulting from raw materials and process operations, as well as the
  need for accelerating product manufacturing, makes dynamic soft sensors such as
  Kalman Filters highly desirable for process development, monitoring, and control.
  In this work, we develop an Ensemble Kalman Filter framework in the context of monoclonal
  antibody bioprocessing, where the noise on physical sensors is mitigated for extracellular
  metabolite states by integrating the processâ€™ dynamic mechanistic model and sensor
  measurements. More importantly, the framework accurately estimates the nucleotide
  sugar concentrations, an intracellular state of the cell that is not routinely measured
  in industry due to experimental complexity. The proposed EnKF soft sensor retrieves
  this knowledge through state inference, providing valuable insights for monitoring
  and control of key quality attributes such as glycan distribution.
