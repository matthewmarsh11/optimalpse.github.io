 abstract = {Complex systems which exhibit different dynamics based on their operating region pose challenges for data driven control because a single global model may not capture the varying dynamics of the system. One solution is to use hybrid system identification to learn the location of operating regions and dynamics within each region from data, yielding a more accurate multi-model of the system. This article proposes a novel method of hybrid system identification through spectral clustering with a custom similarity function. A case study of a chemical process illustrates benefits of this approach for Model Predictive Control.},
