abstract: Complex systems which exhibit different dynamics based on their operating
  region pose challenges for data driven control because a single global model may
  not capture the varying dynamics of the system. One solution is to use hybrid system
  identification to learn the location of operating regions and dynamics within each
  region from data, yielding a more accurate multi-model of the system. This article
  proposes a novel method of hybrid system identification through spectral clustering
  with a custom similarity function. A case study of a chemical process illustrates
  benefits of this approach for Model Predictive Control.
