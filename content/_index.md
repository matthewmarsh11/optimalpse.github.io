        The group has two main branches of research, on one hand, developing new and more efficient optimisation, reinforcement learning and machine learning algorithms that allow to solve general problems in the systems domain. On the other hand, applying existing state-of-the-art techniques to address current challenges in process engineering. Our main area of application has been bioprocesses, although we work on other areas, such as fluid dynamics, photonic mirrors, superstructure optimisation, amongst a few others.
