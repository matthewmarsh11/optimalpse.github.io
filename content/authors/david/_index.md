bio: I am an first year student in the MRes + PhD CDT programme affiliated with the Institute of Chemical Biology. I hold a MEng in Design Engineering, where I developed my analytical brain in optimisation and robotics, and a MRes in Systems & Synthetic Biology, where I explored my passion for engineering life-like systems in synthetic cells. Beyond my academic endeavours, I am an avid Taekwondo martial artist, I enjoy playing the piano, and I am interested in discovering new cultures through languages, history, and cuisines.
