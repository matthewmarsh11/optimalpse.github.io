bio: Dr. Austin Mroz is an Eric and Wendy Schmidt AI in Science Postdoctoral Fellow at Imperial College London. Prior to this, Austin received her PhD under the advisement of Prof. Christopher Hendon in 2021. Here, she focused on developing open source postprocessing software to enhance data analysis of solid-state and molecular calculations and modeling defects in MOFs. Austin then joined the Jelfs Group at Imperial College London as a postdoctoral researcher, where she increased her focus on porous materials design and discovery – specifically developing methods and algorithms to realize novel porous liquids. During this time, Austin also led (under the supervision of Prof. Kim Jelfs) an industry collaboration, where the team demonstrated a fully closed-loop materials discovery workflow driven by Bayesian optimization. Inspired by this industry collaboration, and as an AI in Science Postdoctoral Fellow, Austin is now focusing on developing the framework and algorithms that facilitate and underpin closed-loop, autonomous materials discovery initiatives. Her research interests include, materials discovery methods and algorithms, generative AI, symbolic ML, and data-driven optimization.

interests:
  - Closed-loop materials and chemical discovery 
  - Data-driven optimization
  - Abstract algorithms for chemical property prediction 
  - Integrated and seamless dataflows
  - Symbolic ML
