bio: My name is Luxi and I’m a final year PhD student co-supervised by Cleo Kontoravdi and Antonio del Rio Chanona. My research interest lies in between process modelling simulation and biotherapeutics production in mammalian cell culture. My PhD project consists of both the computational side and the experimental side in the wet lab. 

interests:
  - State Estimation in biotherapeutics production process, specifically in mammalian cell culture.
  - Bioprocess soft sensing, monitoring and control with mechanistic, data driven and hybrid models.
  - Biotherapeutics online quality control.
